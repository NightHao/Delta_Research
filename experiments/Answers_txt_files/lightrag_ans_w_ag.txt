Answer: D-LINK_ERROR.request is a communication primitive utilized in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, specifically between the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and the electric vehicle (EV). It serves as a critical mechanism for managing communication loss situations that may arise during the operation of the data link established for charging and validation processes.

### Key Features of D-LINK_ERROR.request:


### 1. **Purpose**
The primary function of D-LINK_ERROR.request is to signal a detected loss of the data link between the EV and the EVSE. This loss can occur after the establishment of a data link, necessitating a response to ensure continued communication and proper functioning of the charging process.


### 2. **Initiation**
The request is sent by a higher layer entity known as the Higher Level Entity (HLE). HLE oversees the communication process and is responsible for managing error requests and state transitions. When HLE detects a communication issue, it issues a D-LINK_ERROR.request to prompt corrective actions.


### 3. **Action Requested**
Upon receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request, the lower layers of the communication stack are instructed to terminate the current data link. This termination is essential to reset the communication state and prepare for a potential reconnection.


### 4. **State Transition**
The D-LINK_ERROR.request triggers a change in the state of the EV’s communication node. Specifically, the EV will maintain its current state but will transition the matching state to 'unmatched'. This indicates that the EV is no longer in a valid communication state with the EVSE.


### 5. **Restarting the Matching Process**
Following the termination of the data link, the D-LINK_ERROR.request also requests the lower layers to restart the matching process. This is crucial for re-establishing a valid communication link and ensuring that the charging process can continue effectively.


### 6. **Implementation by EVSE**
The EVSE's communication node is required to respond to the D-LINK_ERROR.request by implementing one of two specified options, which are not detailed in the provided information but are part of the protocol for handling such requests.


### 7. **Relation to Other Primitives**
The D-LINK_ERROR.request is part of a broader set of communication primitives that include D-LINK_READY.indication, which informs both the EV and EVSE about the status of the communication link, indicating whether the data link setup was successful or failed.

In summary, D-LINK_ERROR.request is a vital component of the communication protocol between EVs and EVSEs, designed to manage and rectify communication losses, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Question: What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?

Answer: D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a primitive signal utilized by Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to initiate a transition into a power-saving mode while maintaining the communication link status as 'Matched'. This request is essential for both the Electric Vehicle (EV) and the EVSE, as it allows them to enter a sleep mode, thereby conserving energy while still being able to resume normal operations when needed.

When the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is received, the following actions occur:

1. **For EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)**:
   - The EVSE switches to control pilot state X1.
   - It may also transition its low-layer communication module into a low-power mode to further conserve energy.
   - The logical network parameter set, which contains essential information for maintaining the communication link, is stored. This ensures that the data link can be re-established seamlessly after the sleep phase.

2. **For EV (Electric Vehicle)**:
   - The EV changes to control pilot state Bx.
   - Unpowering the low-layer communication module is optional for the EV, meaning it can choose to remain powered or enter a low-power state.
   - Similar to the EVSE, the logical network parameter set is stored to facilitate the continuation of the data link after waking from sleep mode.

Overall, D-LINK_PAUSE.request plays a critical role in energy management for both the EV and EVSE, allowing them to reduce power consumption during periods of inactivity while ensuring that they can quickly and efficiently resume their operational states when necessary. This functionality is particularly important in the context of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, where efficient energy use and communication reliability are paramount.
