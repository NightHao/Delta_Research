**D-LINK_ERROR.request** is a communication event within electric vehicle (EV) communication systems, specifically defined in the context of the ISO 15118 standards. This event plays a crucial role in managing communication errors between the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and the Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (EVCC).

### Functionality

The **D-LINK_ERROR.request** serves two primary functions:

1. **Termination of Data Link**: It requests the termination of the data link between the EV and the EVSE. This is essential when a communication error is detected, ensuring that the system can reset and attempt to re-establish a connection.

2. **Restarting the Matching Process**: Upon detecting a loss of communication, this event initiates the process of restarting the matching sequence. This is done by transitioning through a specific state (state E) to ensure that the system can recover from the error and re-establish communication effectively.

### Context in Communication Protocols

The **D-LINK_ERROR.request** is part of the error handling mechanisms defined in the ISO 15118-3:2015 standard. It is triggered when a loss of communication is detected, allowing the EVSE to manage communication errors and transition states during the charging process. This ensures that both the EV and EVSE can respond appropriately to communication failures, maintaining the integrity of the charging session.

### Summary

In summary, **D-LINK_ERROR.request** is a critical event in the EV communication protocol that facilitates error management by terminating the current data link and initiating a restart of the matching process, thereby ensuring reliable communication between electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Question: What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?

Answer: ## Overview of D-LINK_PAUSE.request

The **D-LINK_PAUSE.request** is a communication event used in the context of electric vehicle (EV) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) interactions. This request is significant for managing the power-saving modes during the communication process between the EV and EVSE.

### Functionality

- **Purpose**: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is designed to initiate the transition of both the EV and EVSE into a sleep mode. This mode is intended to conserve energy while maintaining the 'Matched' state, which allows for a quick resumption of communication when needed.
- **Operation**: Upon receiving this request, the EV will change to a control pilot state (specifically state Bx), while the EVSE will switch to control pilot state X1. The low-layer communication module may be powered off, but the logical network parameter set must be stored to ensure that the data link can continue after the sleep phase.

### Context in Communication Protocols

The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is part of the broader communication protocols defined in standards such as ISO 15118, which govern the interactions between electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. It plays a crucial role in managing the operational states of the devices involved, particularly during periods of inactivity.

### Related Events

- **D-LINK_READY.indication**: This event informs the higher layers about changes in the communication link status, which may occur after the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is processed.
- **D-LINK_TERMINATE.request**: This event is used to terminate the data link, which can also be triggered by communication errors or other operational needs.

## Conclusion

The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is an essential command within the EV and EVSE communication framework, facilitating energy conservation while ensuring that the system remains ready for future interactions.
