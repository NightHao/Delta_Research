Question: What is Logical Network?

Answer: ### Definition of Logical Network

A **Logical Network** in the context of the ISO 15118 standard refers to a network configuration that allows Electric Vehicles (EVs) to connect and communicate with Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) using specific parameters. This network is established after a successful matching process between the EV and the EVSE, which involves the exchange of necessary network parameters.

### Key Components of a Logical Network

1. **Matching Process**: The logical network is created following a successful matching process where the EV and EVSE exchange messages such as `CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ` and `CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF`. This ensures that both parties agree on the parameters needed to join the network.

2. **Network Parameters**: The parameters exchanged during the matching process include the Network Master Key (NMK) and Network Identifier (NID). These parameters are crucial for establishing a secure communication link.

3. **Configuration**: The configuration of the low-layer communication module with the logical network parameters can occur using messages like `CM_SET_KEY.REQ` and `CM_SET_KEY.CNF`. This configuration can happen at any time, even before the matching process is completed.

4. **Point-to-Point Communication**: The logical network operates on a point-to-point basis, meaning that it does not require specific association procedures at the physical layer. This simplifies the communication process between the EV and EVSE.

5. **Failure Handling**: If the EV or EVSE fails to establish a link within a specified time frame (e.g., after receiving the `CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF`), the matching process is considered failed, and appropriate error handling procedures are initiated.

### Conclusion

In summary, a logical network is a structured communication framework that enables EVs to connect with EVSEs securely and efficiently, facilitating the exchange of energy and data.

3. **Repetition and Timing**: The Test System may count the number of `CM_VALIDATE.REQ` messages sent, including those with specific `pilotTimer` values, and checks if the SUT limits the number of retries to a specified maximum (e.g., 2 retries).

### Test Cases Involving CM_VALIDATE.REQ

Several test cases reference the `CM_VALIDATE.REQ` message, including:

- **TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_CmValidate_004**: This test case involves counting the number of repetitions of `CM_VALIDATE.REQ` messages while waiting for a response.
- **TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_CmValidate_005**: This case checks the behavior of the SUT when an invalid `signalType` is sent in the `CM_VALIDATE.CNF` message.

These test cases ensure that the SUT behaves correctly under various conditions and adheres to the specifications outlined in the ISO 15118 standard.

### Conclusion

The `CM_VALIDATE.REQ` message is a critical component in the validation process of EV charging systems, facilitating communication between the Test System and the SUT to ensure compliance with the ISO 15118 standards.

Question: What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?

Answer: ### D-LINK_PAUSE.request Overview

The **D-LINK_PAUSE.request** is a primitive used in the communication protocol between Electric Vehicles (EV) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) as defined in the ISO 15118-3 standard. This request is part of the process to manage communication links and power-saving modes.

#### Functionality

- **Purpose**: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is used to request the lower layers to enter a power-saving mode. While in this mode, the communication link status is maintained as "Matched," allowing for a seamless transition back to active communication when needed.
  
- **Behavior on EV Side**: Upon receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, the EV changes to control pilot state Bx. The unpowering of the low-layer communication module is optional, but the logical network parameters are stored to continue the data link after the sleep phase.

- **Behavior on EVSE Side**: Similarly, the EVSE switches to control pilot state X1 and may also switch its low-layer communication module into a low-power mode. Like the EV, it retains the logical network parameters for resuming communication.
