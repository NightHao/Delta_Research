      "content=\"Signal Level Attenuation Characterization (SLAC) is a protocol and process used primarily in the context of electric vehicle (EV) communication systems, particularly for managing and assessing signal quality during the charging process. It involves measuring and analyzing the attenuation of signals transmitted over communication channels, specifically in systems that utilize Power Line Communication (PLC) technology.\\n\\n### Key Aspects of Signal Level Attenuation Characterization:\\n\\n1. **Purpose**: \\n   - The primary goal of SLAC is to ensure effective communication between Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and electric vehicles (EVs) by characterizing signal levels and managing signal attenuation. This is crucial for maintaining reliable data transmission and ensuring that the communication link is robust enough to support the necessary protocols for charging and vehicle-to-grid interactions.\\n\\n2. **Measurement of Signal Attenuation**:\\n   - SLAC involves quantifying the reduction in signal strength as it travels through the communication medium, which is typically measured in decibels (dB).

This ensures that the communication link is maintained in a minimal energy state while still being ready to resume normal operations when needed.\\n\\n3. **State Management**: While in power-saving mode, the system maintains its state as 'Matched', which indicates that the connection between the EV and EVSE is still valid and can be reactivated without needing to re-establish the entire communication link.\\n\\n4. **Logical Network Parameter Storage**: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request protocol also stipulates that the logical network parameters must be stored. This allows for a seamless continuation of data link operations after the device exits the power-saving mode, ensuring that communication can resume efficiently.\\n\\n5. **Compliance with Standards**: The actions taken upon receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request are specified in the requirement V2G3-M07-20, which is part of the broader V2G3 standard. This standard outlines the necessary protocols and procedures for effective communication and energy management between EVs and EVSEs.\\n\\n6. **Communication Management**: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a protocol primitive that manages communication pauses between entities such as Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment, ensuring that both parties can effectively manage their energy consumption and communication needs.\\n\\nIn summary, the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a critical command in the vehicle-to-grid communication framework, facilitating energy efficiency and effective communication management between electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 486, 'prompt_tokens': 2525, 'total_tokens': 3011, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0392822090', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-3584491a-1693-4c17-9c7a-edf52f978e1c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2525, 'output_tokens': 486, 'total_tokens': 3011, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"
