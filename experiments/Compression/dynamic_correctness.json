However, it omits crucial architectural layering (physical, data link, network/transport, application, back-end), specific details about on-board charger/power electronics, SLAC procedure, secure network transport (TLS), message confidentiality (TCP/TLS), and the explicit role of OCPP/back-end/grid integration. The physical connector (IEC 62196) and aggregator/utility dispatch to the EVSE are also missing. The omission of these specific architectural and protocol details warrants a deduction."

The Actual Output is more general, missing detailed mappings, responsibilities (e.g., verdict computation, physical interface testing), and lacks specifics such as V2G5-027 to V2G5-034, making it less complete."

However, it omits highly relevant details: no explicit mention of the use of RFID/card/app as EIM forms, skips the role of requirement numbers (such as V2G3-M06-04/-08), does not clarify EIM happens before plugging in, lacks details on status/exchange with backend, and misses specific test case references (e.g. TC_SECC_AC_VTB_CMSLACPARM_004), resulting in notable but not total omission of detail."
