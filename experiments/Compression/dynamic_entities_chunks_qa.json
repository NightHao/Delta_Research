    "What is CM_AMP_MAP.REQ?": "CM_AMP_MAP.REQ is a command used in a communication system to facilitate the exchange of amplitude map data between two hosts through a low-layer communication module. This command serves two primary functions depending on the context of the message's source and destination.\n\n1. **Purpose**: The CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command is designed to request the counterpart low-layer communication module to reduce the transmission power for specific carriers. This is essential for optimizing communication performance and ensuring that the transmission power aligns with the required parameters for effective signal processing.\n\n2. **Functionality**: When a device sends a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command, it includes specific amplitude map data (AMDATA) that represents the requested transmission power values for each carrier. The values are typically referenced against a baseline of \u221250 dBm/Hz, which serves as a standard for comparison.\n\n3. **Confirmation Process**: Upon receiving the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command, the counterpart node is required to confirm the request by sending back a CM_AMP_MAP.CNF message. This confirmation is crucial for ensuring that the request has been acknowledged and processed.\n\n4. **Retransmission Protocol**: If the low-layer communication module that sent the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ does not receive a valid CM_AMP_MAP.CNF response within a specified timeout period (max(TT_match_response)), it is mandated to retransmit the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ. This ensures reliability in communication, as it accounts for potential message loss or delays.\n\n5. **Handling Retransmissions**: If the requested node receives a subsequent CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, it indicates that the original request was not confirmed, prompting the node to respond to the request again. This mechanism helps maintain the integrity of the communication process.\n\nIn summary, CM_AMP_MAP.REQ is a critical command in the communication protocol that facilitates the exchange of amplitude map data, allowing for adjustments in transmission power based on specific carrier requirements, while also ensuring reliable communication through confirmation and retransmission protocols.",
