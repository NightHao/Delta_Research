        "reason": "The actual output provides accurate general information on HPGP's purpose, application in EV charging, powerline communication, and mentions standards compliance (ISO, IEEE) and features like OFDM, signal coupling, and low-power communication. However, it omits technical specifics present in the expected output: details about coupling (transformers/capacitance), Control Pilot modulation practices, ISO 15118 and V2G3\u2011A11 explicit requirements, precise roles of SLAC protocol and CCo/AVLN network formation, specific MAC/PHY behaviors, EMC/ESD and coexistence protocols, and commissioning/testing procedures. No factual contradictions, but several granular implementation and protocol-stack details are missing."

However, it omits significant technical details included in the Expected Output, such as the explicit message names (CM_SLAC_PARM_REQ, etc.), matching process steps, and the explicit control of HPGP network joining and message encapsulation in raw Ethernet (MMEs). These omissions of stepwise procedural and message-level detail, as well as the precise timer names and validation message flows, result in substantial penalization for lack of full detail."

However, it omits or only vaguely mentions critical technical details found in the expected output, such as the Network Membership Key (NMK), specific references to SLAC/MME (including CM_SLAC_MATCH), explicit join/leave timing (TP_match_leave), and the leave/reset sequence. It also lacks mention of higher-level protocol transparency and specific error scenarios (like D-LINK_ERROR.request). Thus, it's penalized for omission of these important details."

The expected output also provides a much more technical breakdown of message types and protocol stacks, which is omitted.

However, it omits many technical specifics, including named protocol messages (SLAC, CmValidate, CmSlacMatch, etc.), the exact ports and interfaces (pt_SLAC_Port, pt_HAL_61851_Port), that PTC is purely a physical-layer/IEC 61851-1 monitor&stimulus, and that MTC can represent EVCC_Tester or SECC_Tester. The details about PTC not running TTCN-3, specific test procedures (V2G5-027\u2013030), and that only MTC sends protocol messages are also missing. The core high-level differences are accurate, but omission of concrete details significantly lowers the score."

However, it omits explicit mention of key parameters like C_EV_start_atten_char_inds and TP_EV_batch_msg_interval, does not mention receipt/action details by the EVSE (sending of M-SOUND bursts, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), and gives less detail on specific conformance test requirements, thus missing important details from the expected output."

However, there are notable omissions: there is no mention of specific timing requirements (TT_EV_atten_results, TP_EVSE_avg_atten_calc), test-case IDs and their functional focus, absence of detail about the payload format and where ATTEN_PROFILE can have multiple entries (per M-Sound), and no explicit reference to the exact table defining the message.
