        "score": 0.7918686345679088,
        "reason": "The actual output includes all major architectural components (EV, EVCC, SECC, grid interaction, ISO 15118, PLC, HLC-C, protocols like SessionStopReq and SDP, conformance/testing) present in the expected output, and does not contradict any facts therein. However, some low-level physical details (e.g. Booster Circuit Breaker, B1/B2 transitions, SLAC for PLC setup, explicit mention of PWM and distribution of specific EVSE hardware) are omitted or only implicitly covered. The overall flow, standards, domains, and technical specifics are correct and mostly complete, but lacks a few fine-grained details."

        "score": 0.8904650529316847,
        "reason": "The actual output covers almost all key facts from the expected output: virtual, Layer 2 scope; use of NMK for segmentation; CCo management; co-existence of logical networks; visibility at higher layers; error handling and leave behavior; use of MMEs for joining. However, it omits naming the 'SLAC matching process' and explicit mention of 'CM_SLAC_MATCH exchange' and 'D-LINK_TERMINATE.request', and isn't as precise with join/leave triggers as the expected output. No factual contradictions are present, and no major detail is wrongly omitted, but these omitted SLAC/matching specifics merit a penalty."

        "score": 0.7961902220646461,
        "reason": "The actual output accurately distinguishes basic signaling and high-level communication, aligning with the expected output on major technical points such as role, standards (IEC 61851-1 and ISO 15118-3), use of analog PWM duty cycle for basic signaling, and PLC/ISO 15118 for HLC. It covers fallback mechanisms, advanced use cases, and even specific requirements from V2G3 M06-02. Some low-level technical details (e.g., names of state letters A-F, specifics about analog filtering, exact sequence of PLC handshaking, and protocol-level error management like SLAC, ACK/NACK, timers) are omitted, which prevents a perfect score."

        "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output in terms of describing CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND as a message in the SLAC protocol for starting attenuation characterization, its role in stopping TT_match_sequence, test case usage, timing requirement (V2G3-A09-26), MME compliance, and its relation to response messages like CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND. However, it omits some specific details: the explicit M-SOUND exchange trigger, precise message parameter names (e.g., C_EV_START_ATTEN_CHAR_INDS, TP_EV_batch_msg_interval), and the standards references V2G3-A06-05 and explicit formatting validation in test cases. These omitted specifics result in a moderate penalty."

It also covers its role in attenuation measurement and mentions test cases. However, it omits the specific decrementing 'cnt' field, and misses the explicit broadcast sequence timing details after CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND and the instruction that low-layer modules must not respond (per V2G3-A06-05).

It covers message purpose, triggering process, field details (APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE, SOURCE_ADDRESS, NUM_SOUNDS, ATTEN_PROFILE), standards (V2G3-A09-22, etc.), and response behavior via CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP. However, it omits some explicit details like the 'runID' field, does not specify the exact structure (MME_Header + MME_Payload), and does not mention the precise calculation of ATTEN_PROFILE entries or the EV action of computing Average_Attenuation for decision-making, resulting in minor penalties for omission of detail."

However, it omits some process details from the Expected Output, such as the result code reporting the outcome of processing, specifics about the payload confirming the EV\u2019s measured attenuation profile, and the explicit emphasis on the message being sent by the EVCC (low-layer module).

However, it omits mention of IEC-61851-24 and HomePlug Green PHY, details regarding the profile as a sub-carrier vector, arithmetic mean averaging in CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, explicit EVSE Listening Process, and the message's non-command nature.

However, it omits crucial technical detail such as specific standard references (like V2G3-A09-60), the TT_MATCH_SEQUENCE timer, explicit MME field/table references, and the specific SLAC use cases/test-case naming.

It omits a few details, such as mention of C_EV_match_retry as the retry parameter, other SLAC-specific fields per Table A.7, and the precise EVSE timer actions (e.g., TT_MATCH_RESPONSE) and stopping of TT_MATCH_SEQUENCE, resulting in a minor detail penalty."

While the output covers most technical details (purpose, timing constraints, required content, error handling, and test cases), it omits some precise field-by-field detail (e.g., the ordered list/runID matching, explicit mention of required timer behavior like TT_match_response delay before sending), lacks explicit mention of EVSE waiting for the timer before sending, and does not reference post-reception actions (V2G3-A09-101) or CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ retry limits, leading to a minor omission penalty."

However, it omits mention that CM_SET_KEY.REQ is part of the SLAC stack, that it is triggered specifically after SLAC matching (e.g., after CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF), and omits details about the explicit field structure (key type, value encoding), and exact timing/use-cases (plug-in, rekeying events)."

However, it omits mention of SLAC as a standard, does not explicitly state that it is a Management-Message-Entity (MME), and lacks detailed breakdowns such as the message having no additional payload beyond result code and its role as the 'green light' to proceed.
