TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The validation process is divided in two parts consisting of a CM_VALIDATE.REQ and CM_VALIDATE.CNF each. It is important to consider that the first and second request-response differ in the contents of the messages. In the following messages related to the first/second request-response are designated with “step 1” or “step 2”, respectively.
Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS.
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP.
Text 5: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP].
Text 6: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
Text 7: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.4;
Text 8: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the most probable EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.3;
Text 9: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_NOT_FOUND, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 10: A.9.3.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.3.3.2 EV side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If any received CM_VALIDATE.REQ contains invalid content, it shall be ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.5 and Table A.6 is inva- lid.
Text 11: A.9.3.3.3 EVSE side (Context: A.9.3.3.3 EVSE side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If any CM_VALIDATE.REQ contains a result field other than “ready”, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 12: 9.4 Validation of matching decision (Context: 9.4 Validation of matching decision > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - After the signal strength measurement, the EV can decide on the basis of the results to request the EVSE for an additional validation process. As soon as the EVSE is ready to detect the control pilot line, the EV sends a random timer value TP_EV_vald_toggle to the EVSE. After sending the message, the EV switches the control pilot state in the sequence B-C-B. This switching sequence is called BCB-Toggle in the following.
Text 13: 9.4 Validation of matching decision (Context: 9.4 Validation of matching decision > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - The number of BCB-Toggles (C_EV_vald_nb_toggles) is chosen randomly in the available time.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: The validation process is an asynchronous process, which means that an unmatched EVSE answers to a CM_VALIDATE.REQ in any case even with no signal strength measurement immediately before. This behaviour is necessary because the time between the signal strength measurement and the validation for a specific EVSE is not predictable due to an unknown number of validation processes with other EVSEs before. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 2: To request a validation process, the EV sends a first CM_VALIDATE.REQ to the EVSE, which contains a timer value of zero and a result field indicating “ready”. The EVSE responds with a first CM_VALIDATE. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 3: CNF, which contains a ToggleNum of zero. The result field of the message is filled in consistence with the current state of the EVSE: (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 4: — When the EVSE is ready to perform the validation process, it fills the result field with “ready”. In this case, the EV will continue with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 5: — When the EVSE is busy and not able to perform a validation, it fills the result field with “not ready”. In this case, the EVSE is not ready for the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ. The EV may start a retry by resending the first CM_VALIDATE.REQ again. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 6: — When the EVSE wants to indicate that a validation is not required, it fills the result field with “not required”. In this case, the EV may follow this advice and stop the validation process or continue the process with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ to force the EVSE to follow the validation process. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 7: — In any special case where the EVSE is not able to perform any validation process or it does not have implemented the validation process feature, it fills the result field with “failure”. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 8: The second part of the validation process covers the control pilot toggle sequence on EV side and the counting of control pilot toggles on the EVSE side. The EV starts this process by sending the step 2 indicating “ready”. With receiving the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ, the EVSE starts counting the BCB- toggles for a time window given by the timer field of the request. As soon as the timer expires, the EVSE sends a step 2 CM_VALIDATE.CNF to the EV containing the number of BCB-Toggles seen and the result field filled with “Success”. The field is filled with “failure” whenever the validation could not be performed or the number of seen BCB-Toggles does not contain valid data. (sibling of Text 1)
