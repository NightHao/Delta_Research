Text 1: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message.
Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The ATTEN_PROFILE within the message CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND shall be calcu- lated by arithmetic mean of the ATTEN_PROFILE of the CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND of previous M-SOUNDS corrected by the attenuation of the receive path AttnRx- EVSE as described in A.9.4.1.
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The Average_Attenuation used for matching decision shall be calculated by the arithmetic mean of all groups in the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. To take implementation specifics into account, a weighted average may be used. When using a weighted average, the sum of the weights of all groups shall be one.
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.
Text 5: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS.
Text 6: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP.
Text 7: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP].
Text 8: A.9.2.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.2.3.2 EV side > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the NUM_SOUNDS field in a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND is zero, then the ATTEN_ PROFILE has no significance and the whole messages shall be ignored. It is up to the EV to decide what number of M-SOUNDS used for the attenuation profile is sufficient for its decision (i.e. whether to discard CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND if NUM_ SOUNDs is less than C_EV_match_MNBC).
Text 9: A.9.2.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.2.3.2 EV side > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EV receives a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND with invalid content, it shall be ignored.
Text 10: A.9.2.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.2.3.2 EV side > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND is received and its origin is an EVSE that has not sent a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF before, the message shall be processed and not ignored.
Text 11: A.9.2.3.3 EVSE side (Context: A.9.2.3.3 EVSE side > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EVSE has not received a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP within TT_match_response, it shall retransmit a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND when the TT_match_response expires and reset this timer. After C_EV_match_retry attempts, if no CM_ATTEN_CHAR. RSP is received by the EVSE, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 12: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
