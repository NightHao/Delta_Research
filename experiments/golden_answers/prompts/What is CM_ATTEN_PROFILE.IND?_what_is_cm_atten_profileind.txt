TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The ATTEN_PROFILE within the message CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND shall be calcu- lated by arithmetic mean of the ATTEN_PROFILE of the CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND of previous M-SOUNDS corrected by the attenuation of the receive path AttnRx- EVSE as described in A.9.4.1.
Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS.
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP.
Text 5: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP].
Text 6: Calibration and correction (Context: Calibration and correction > A.11.4 Signal transmission path and signal measurement > A.11 Signal coupling) - The low-layer communication module on EV side does not know the value of AttnRxEVSE. Since this value has an impact on the SLAC measurement, the EVSE has to correct the measurement values by AttnRxEVSE before reporting the values back to the EV.
Text 7: A.11.4.1 Typical transmission path (Context: A.11.4.1 Typical transmission path > A.11.4 Signal transmission path and signal measurement > A.11 Signal coupling) - AttnRxEVSE is the insertion loss of the receiving path between the HomePlug Green PHY Modem and the charge coupler on EVSE side. In the example, a value of 3 dB is assumed (e.g. through to transformers, lines, coupling components).

Related Information 27: In the example, the design target is to achieve a PSD at the inlet of device of −76 dBm/Hz over the spectrum. Due to insertion losses in the transmission path (AttnTxEV), the output power of the modem (−72 dBm/Hz) has to be higher to compensate the attenuation AttnTxEV.

Related Information 28: The charge cord attenuates the HomePlug Green PHY signal by AttnCord, which leads in the example to a PSD at the counterpart socket-outlet of −78 dBm/Hz. Within the EVSE, the signal is also affected by an insertion loss (AttnRxEVSE) of the Rx path from the socket-outlet to the Green PHY modem. (sibling of Text 7)
