Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.4;
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the most probable EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.3;
Text 5: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_NOT_FOUND, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 6: A.9.5.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.5.3.2 EV side > A.9.5 Joining the logical network > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - It is up to the implementation how to handle a negative response in a CM_SET_KEY.CNF or a missing CM_SET_KEY.CNF at all.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: After the right matching between EV and EVSE is determined and the network parameters are exchanged, the EV joins the logical network of the EVSE. Through the broadcast domain is reduced to the low-layer communciation module directly connected. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 2: The configuration of the low-layer communication module with the parameters of the logical network may be done with the MMEs CM_SET_KEY.REQ and CM_SET_KEY.CNF. On EVSE side, there is no constraint that the network parameters have to be configured after the CM_ SLAC_MATCH.CNF. This can also be done any time before. (sibling of Text 1)

Contextual Information 2: A.9.5 Joining the logical network (ancestor of Text 1)
Contextual Information 3: A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process (ancestor of Text 1)
Related Information 3: By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way. (sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 4: After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS. Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP. (sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 5: The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP]. (sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 6: [V2G3-A09-17] The SLAC implementation of the low-layer communciation module on EV and EVSE side shall be compliant with the messages defined in [HPGP]. (sibling of Text 2)

(sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 9: [V2G3-A09-20] The Average_Attenuation used for matching decision shall be calculated by the arithmetic mean of all groups in the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. To take implementation specifics into account, a weighted average may be used. When using a weighted average, the sum of the weights of all groups shall be one. (sibling of Text 2)
