TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.1.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.1.1 Functional description > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Before the signal strength measurement starts, the EV broadcasts the parameters to be used for the following signal strength measurement sequence by means of the message CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ. Any
Text 2: A.9.1.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.1.1 Functional description > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - unmatched EVSE which receives the parameter exchange broadcast sends a response to the EV by means of the message CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF.
Text 3: A.9.1.2 Description of involved MMEs (Context: A.9.1.2 Description of involved MMEs > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - [V2G3-A09-04] The MMEs for the parameter exchange shall be used with the following content and be sent as Ethernet unicast/broadcast messages as defined.
Text 4: A.9.1.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.1.3.2 EV side > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - [V2G3-A09-10] If no valid CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF arrives at the EV when TT_match_response expires, the EV shall retransmit the request and wait again for TT_match_ response. The total number of retries is given by C_EV_match_retry. If C_EV_ match_retry is reached, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 5: A.9.1.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.1.3.2 EV side > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - [V2G3-A09-09] If the EV receives a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF with invalid content, it shall be ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.2 is invalid.
Text 6: A.9.8.1 Example of matching process error handling (Context: A.9.8.1 Example of matching process error handling > A.9.8 General error handling and timing constraints > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Figure A.9 gives an example of matching process error handling. The low-layer communication module of the EV is awake and the low-layer communication module of the EVSE is asleep. The EVCC sends first CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ message immediately after cable plug-in. The EVSE has to boot its low-layer communication module and is not able to answer the CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ message. After the low-layer communication module on the EVSE side is ready for communication, it sends a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF.
