TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: 7.5 Loss of communication (Context: 7.5 Loss of communication > 7 Connection coordination > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - This Clause covers the situation where the communication link is lost. A loss of communication after the establishment of a data link [D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) was already indicated] is handled by higher layers, by requesting with D-LINK_ERROR.request.
Text 2: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug- in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching process (state “Matching” in Figure 11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11.
Text 3: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any transition from the state “Matching” triggers a call of the primitive D-LINK_READY.indication to indicate a successful or failed data-link setup.
Text 4: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any loss of the control pilot or a request from HLE leads to a reset to state “Unmatched”.

Related Information 8: A unique matching between the EV and a specific charge coupler of the EVSE is necessary for most of the use cases. After the matching process, which is defined within this Clause, upper layers are able to proceed their binding process. Interfaces related to data link status between the layers are defined in Clause 12. Depending on the communication signal paths, the matching process depends on the infrastructure topology.
