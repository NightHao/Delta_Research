TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: 7.6.2 Wake-up (Context: 7.6.2 Wake-up > 7.6 Sleep mode and wake-up > 7 Connection coordination) - [V2G3-M07-21] As soon as the lower layers detect a data link after a wake-up, it shall send a D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) to HLE.
Text 2: 9.5 Set-up a logical network (Context: 9.5 Set-up a logical network > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - [V2G3-M09-16] As soon as the EV has successfully joined the logical network of the EVSE, both entities are in the status “Matched”. The communication node shall inform HLE through the D-LINK_READY.indication (link established) that HLE’s binding pro- cess can begin.
Text 3: 9.6 Leave the logical network (Context: 9.6 Leave the logical network > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - [V2G3-M09-18] When the low-layer communication module leaves the logical network, it shall inform HLE through the D-LINK_READY.indication (no link).
Text 4: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug- in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching process (state “Matching” in Figure 11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11.
Text 5: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any transition from the state “Matching” triggers a call of the primitive D-LINK_READY.indication to indicate a successful or failed data-link setup.
Text 6: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any loss of the control pilot or a request from HLE leads to a reset to state “Unmatched”.
Text 7: A.9.6.3.2 EV and EVSE sides (Context: A.9.6.3.2 EV and EVSE sides > A.9.6 Amplitude map exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - [V2G3-A09-120] The time between the detection of other stations in the current logical network after the SLAC_MATCH exchange and the indication D-LINK_READY.indication (link established) to higher layers shall not exceed the performance timer TP_ link_ready_notification.
Text 8: 7.5 Loss of communication (Context: 7.5 Loss of communication > 7 Connection coordination > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - This Clause covers the situation where the communication link is lost. A loss of communication after the establishment of a data link [D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) was already indicated] is handled by higher layers, by requesting with D-LINK_ERROR.request.
Text 9: 7.5 Loss of communication (Context: 7.5 Loss of communication > 7 Connection coordination > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - [V2G3-M07-03] If a data link was established and a D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) was already indicated to higher layers, any detected loss of the data link shall cause a D-LINK_READY.indication(no link) indication to higher layers.

Related Information 5: A unique matching between the EV and a specific charge coupler of the EVSE is necessary for most of the use cases.
