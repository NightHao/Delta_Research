TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: [V2G3-M12-01] (Context: [V2G3-M12-01] > 12.3 Data link control SAP to layer 3 > 12 Layer 2 interfaces) - The D-LINK_TERMINATE.request requests lower layers to terminate the data link.
Text 2: A.9.7 Leave the logical network (Context: A.9.7 Leave the logical network > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process > Annex A (normative) HomePlug Green PHY on control pilot line) - [V2G3-A09-121] With receiving a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request from HLE, the low-layer commu- nication module shall leave the logical network, reset the NMK, and switch to matching state “Unmatched”. The low-layer communciation module shall follow the Clause “Leaving an AVLN” defined in the [HPGP].
Text 3: 9.6 Leave the logical network (Context: 9.6 Leave the logical network > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - [V2G3-M09-17] With receiving a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request from HLE, the communication node shall leave the logical network within TP_match_leave. All parameters related to the current link shall be set to the default value and shall change to the status “Unmatched”.
Text 4: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug- in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching process (state “Matching” in Figure 11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11.
Text 5: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any transition from the state “Matching” triggers a call of the primitive D-LINK_READY.indication to indicate a successful or failed data-link setup.
Text 6: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any loss of the control pilot or a request from HLE leads to a reset to state “Unmatched”.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: The D-LINK_READY.indication shall inform higher layers about a change of com- munication link status. This indication shall be sent with any change in link status.

Related Information 12: A unique matching between the EV and a specific charge coupler of the EVSE is necessary for most of the use cases. After the matching process, which is defined within this Clause, upper layers are able to proceed their binding process. Interfaces related to data link status between the layers are defined in Clause 12. Depending on the communication signal paths, the matching process depends on the infrastructure topology. (sibling of Text 4)
Related Information 13: Under some technical conditions, the matching process might render ambiguous results. In this case, an additional validation process based on a signalling through the control pilot line can be necessary to confirm the matching. (sibling of Text 4)
