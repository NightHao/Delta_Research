Related Information 10: As HomePlug Green PHY signal’s coupling is directly linked to the control pilot, the schematic in [IEC-1], Annex A specification is basis for definitions regarding the control pilot signal. (sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 11: To enable HomePlug Green PHY injection, the path from EVSE’s output to EV’s input should not be considered as capacitive only as it is sufficient for the low frequency control pilot signal.

To take the high frequency into account, the control pilot circuit and the component values have to be specified in more detail. (sibling of Text 2)

Related Information 19: NOTE 1 Any capacity on the control pilot line which is directly connected between the control pilot line and ground should be as small as possible, not to attenuate the HomePlug Green PHY signal in an excessive way. Most of the capacitive load should be separated from the high frequency HomePlug Green PHY with the inductor L. (sibling of Text 6)
Related Information 20: NOTE 2 At given impedance, the maximum peak to peak amplitude is directly linked to the PSD, also defined in Table A.11. For the purpose of limiting the impact of the high frequency signal on the control pilot line, a simplification from definition in frequency domain to a peak-to-peak voltage is sufficient.
