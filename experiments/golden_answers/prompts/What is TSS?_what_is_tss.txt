TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: CSV file (Context: CSV Data) - test suite structure
Text 2: 7.2 Test suite structure (TSS) (Context: 7.2 Test suite structure (TSS) > 7 Test suite conventions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests) - A test suite is a complete set of test cases, possibly combined into groups or modules (e.g. for use cases or domains like AC, DC charging), that are necessary to perform conformance testing for a given SUT.
Text 3: 7.2 Test suite structure (TSS) (Context: 7.2 Test suite structure (TSS) > 7 Test suite conventions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests) - In each test case, the SUT is stimulated with specific inputs and the reactions are observed and evaluated. Depending on the test purpose different pre‐conditions and post‐conditions shall be considered for the formulation of the test behavior. The pre‐conditions, post‐conditions as well as test behaviors are encapsulated into individual functions and stored within separate modules. Thus, a complete test case is composed by the actual test behavior enveloped by pre‐ and post‐conditions (see 7.7.5 for details). The corresponding grouping of functions can therefore be assigned to the lowest abstract hierarchical level (see Figure 2). The test cases are defined on the second level.
Text 4: 7.3 Test profiles (Context: 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests) - This subclause defines test profiles for conformance with ISO 15118‐3. A test profile consists of a test configuration as well as a selection and assignment of PICS/PIXIT. Depending on the test configuration a set of test components and ports are defined. The test profile furthermore includes a test group defining the set of relevant test cases and the sequence in which they are executed in order to perform a conformance test for a given use case.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Contextual Information 1: CSV Data (ancestor of Text 1)
Related Information 1: In each test case, the SUT is stimulated with specific inputs and the reactions are observed and evaluated. Depending on the test purpose different pre‐conditions and post‐conditions shall be considered for the formulation of the test behavior. The pre‐conditions, post‐conditions as well as test behaviors are encapsulated into individual functions and stored within separate modules. Thus, a complete test case is composed by the actual test behavior enveloped by pre‐ and post‐conditions (see 7.7.5 for details). The corresponding grouping of functions can therefore be assigned to the lowest abstract hierarchical level (see Figure 2). The test cases are defined on the second level. (sibling of Text 2)

Related Information 3: The test profile is a collection of self‐contained test cases as well as PICS (see 7.3.3) and PIXIT (see 7.3.4) in order to represent a given use case. The selection is based on the use cases of the ISO 15118 standard and its corresponding requirements. Hence the Test Suite Structure (TSS) is segmented into subgroups defined according to ISO 15118 use cases for conformance testing. Table 1 shows these subgroups, which are used for the organization of the test case specifications as well as for the test suite identifiers (see 7.4 for details). (sibling of Text 2)
