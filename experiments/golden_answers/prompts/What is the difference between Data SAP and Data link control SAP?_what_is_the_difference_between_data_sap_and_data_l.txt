TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: 3.10 DATA SAP (Context: 3.10 DATA SAP > 3 Terms and definitions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - service access point that defines the interface between layer 2 and layer 3 for exchange of v2g-related payload
Text 2: 3.9 data link control SAP (Context: 3.9 data link control SAP > 3 Terms and definitions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - service access point which defines the interface between the connection coordination module and the low-layer communication technology for managing the link status
Text 3: A.6.1.2 Data SAP (Context: A.6.1.2 Data SAP > A.6.1 Layers overview > A.6 System architecture) - The data SAP is the ETH SAP. The ETH SAP is completely covered by the [HPGP].
Text 4: 12.1 Overview (Context: 12.1 Overview > 12 Layer 2 interfaces > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - As shown in Figure 2, the definition of the data link layer provides the following two interfaces to higher layers.
Text 5: 12.1 Overview (Context: 12.1 Overview > 12 Layer 2 interfaces > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - — Data SAP is the interface between the communication technology and the layer 3 (e.g. IPv6).
Text 6: 12.1 Overview (Context: 12.1 Overview > 12 Layer 2 interfaces > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - — The data link control SAP provides link status information, error information, control functionality and is located between the connection coordination and higher layers.
Text 7: 3.11 ETH SAP (Context: 3.11 ETH SAP > 3 Terms and definitions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - This SAP supports applications using Ethernet II-class packets, including IEEE 802.3 with or without IEEE 802.2 (LLC), IEEE 802.1H (SNAP) extensions, and/or VLAN tagging.
Text 8: A.6.1.2 Data SAP (Context: A.6.1.2 Data SAP > A.6.1 Layers overview > A.6 System architecture) - Due to the convergence layer, the data link layer of HomePlug Green PHY provides an Ethernet II-class SAP to higher layers.
Text 9: A.6.1.4 MAC/PHY stack (Context: A.6.1.4 MAC/PHY stack > A.6.1 Layers overview > A.6 System architecture) - The convergence layer adapts the generic HomePlug Green PHY MAC to an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet II-class interface through the ETH SAP.
