Next to using ports for communication purposes, local timers, variables or constants may be assigned to components to store dynamic information during test case execution.
Text 6: 7.7.7 IEC 61851-1 PWM event handling and control (Context: 7.7.7 IEC 61851-1 PWM event handling and control > 7.7 Test case specification > 7 Test suite conventions) - The parallel test component (PTC) for IEC 61851‐1 signaling continuously observes the protocol specific parameters positive voltage (state), frequency, duty cycle and the proximity resistor value in accordance with the defined valid range of values (as defined in IEC 61851‐1:2017, Annex A), during the entire test case execution.
Text 7: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - These components and ports compose relevant test configurations for this document. Whether the type EVCC_Tester or SECC_Tester is to be used as MTC depends on the type of the SUT.
Text 8: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - [V2G5-010] If the SUT is an SECC, the MTC shall use the type SECC_Tester.

Text 10: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - As shown in Figure 3 the port mappings are defined statically as follows:
Text 11: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - — The port pt_SLAC_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_SLAC_Port of the MTC.

Text 13: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - — The port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the v_HAL_61851_Listener. The pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port is from the same type HAL_61851_Port as the pt_HAL_61851_Port.
Text 14: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - — The internal port pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port is not mapped to the TSI. This port is connected between the MTC and PTC.
Text 15: 4 Symbols (and abbreviated terms) (Context: 4 Symbols (and abbreviated terms) > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical layer and data link layer conformance test) - TSI TTCN‐3 System Interface
Text 16: 3.30 test system interface TSI (Context: 3.30 test system interface TSI > 3 Terms and definitions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests) - test component that provides a mapping of the ports available in the (abstract) TTCN‐3 test system to those offered by a real test system
Text 17: 7.3.2 Components and ports (Context: 7.3.2 Components and ports > 7.3 Test profiles > 7 Test suite conventions) - In addition to the MTC and PTC and their corresponding port type definitions, a test configuration also consists of respective Test System Interfaces (TSI). An abstract Test System Interface (TSI) is specified as a collection of ports. A TSI has no local timers, constants or variables. Only ports are assigned to it. During the test case execution test components ports can be mapped dynamically to the TSI ports to establish communication channel to the real test system interface. In the test configuration the TSI uses the type System_EVCC or System_SECC depending on the type of the SUT. If the SUT is an EVCC, the TSI uses the type System_EVCC. If the SUT is an SECC, the TSI uses the type System_SECC.
