Text 1: 6.1 Communication layers overview (Context: 6.1 Communication layers overview > 6 System architecture > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - [ISO-3] defines requirements applicable to layer 1 and layer 2, including V2G standardized service primitive interface, according to the OSI layered architecture. Layer 3 to layer 7 is specified in [ISO-2]

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: This part of ISO 15118 is organized along architectural lines, emphasizing the large-scale separation of the system into two parts: the MAC sublayer of the data link layer and the physical layer. These layers are intended to correspond closely to the lowest layers of the ISO/IEC model for open systems. Figure 1 shows the relationship of the [ISO-3] to the OSI reference model.

Related Information 29: NOTE 4 L and RDamp associated with capacitors form low pass filters, which ensure the basic signalling and HomePlug Green PHY communication at the same time.
