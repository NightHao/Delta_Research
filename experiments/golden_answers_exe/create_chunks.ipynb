      "        │   ├── The pending energy crisis and the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has led the vehicle manufacturers to a very significant effort to reduce the energy consumption of their vehicles. They are presently developing vehicles partly or completly propelled by electric energy. Thus, vehicles will reduce the dependency on oil, improve the global energy efficiency, and reduce the total CO2 emissions for road transportation if the electricity is produced from renewable sources. To charge the batteries of such vehicles, specific charging infrastructure is required.\n",
      "        │   ├── Much of the standardization work on dimensional and electrical specifications of the charging infrastructure and the vehicle interface is already treated in the relevant ISO or IEC groups. However, the question of information transfer between the vehicle and the grid has not been treated sufficiently.\n",
      "        │   ├── Such communication is beneficial for the optimization of energy resources and energy production systems as vehicles can recharge at the most economic or most energy-efficient instants.\n",
      "        │   └── It is also required to develop efficient and convenient payment systems in order to cover the resulting micro-payments. The necessary communication channel might serve in the future to contribute to the stabilization of the electrical grid, as well as to support additional information services required to operate electric vehicles efficiently.\n",
