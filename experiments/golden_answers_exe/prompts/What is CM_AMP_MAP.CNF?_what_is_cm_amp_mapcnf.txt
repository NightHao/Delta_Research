Image Description for Figure A.2:
**Detailed Description of Figure A.2 — Sequence Chart of HomePlug Green PHY Matching Process (Part 2)**

Below is a step‐by‐step walkthrough of the second part of the SLAC (Signal-Level Attenuation Characterization) matching process, as shown in Figure A.2. The figure involves four principal entities:
1. **EV Host**  
2. **EV PLC Node** (the low‐layer communication module on the EV side)  
3. **EVSE PLC Node** (the low‐layer communication module on the EVSE side)  
4. **EVSE Host**  

Several timers are used throughout (e.g., TT_match_response, TT_EVSE_match_MNBC, TT_EV_atten_results, etc.), and numerous message exchanges take place to coordinate the matching, measurement, validation, and eventual linking of the EV and the EVSE. The main goal is to ensure that the EV joins the EVSE’s HomePlug Green PHY network only if the correct EVSE is physically connected.

---

## 1. Entities Shown in the Figure

1. **EV Host**  
   • Triggers and manages part of the matching and SLAC processes on the vehicle side.  
   • May also participate in the amplitude map exchange and final notifications to higher layers.

2. **EV PLC Node**  
   • The low‐layer communication module in the EV.  
   • Sends/receives SLAC‐related messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ), handles attenuation measurement steps (CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP), and initiates validation or matching requests.

3. **EVSE PLC Node**  
   • The low‐layer communication module in the charging station.  
   • Responds to the EV’s messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF), performs attenuation measurements, and returns results (e.g., CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND).  
   • May also carry out a validation procedure upon EV requests and send final match confirmations.

4. **EVSE Host**  
   • Controls higher-level aspects on the EVSE side, including key sets (CM_SET_KEY.REQ) or other logic.  
   • May provide triggers to begin or end the matching process.

## 2. High‐Level Flow Overview

Figure A.2 shows the continuation of the overall HomePlug Green PHY matching process, focusing on:  
- Attenuation measurements using M‐Sound messages and collecting CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND data.  
- Final attenuation confirmations (CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND and CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP).  
- (Optionally) Validation steps (CM_VALIDATE) with possible BCB toggles.  
- Network matching confirmation (CM_SLAC_MATCH).  
- Key setting (CM_SET_KEY) on both sides.  
- Detection of the link and optional amplitude map exchange (CM_AMP_MAPREQ and CM_AMP_MAPCNF).  
- Final “D_LINK_READY” notification to the higher layers once the link is established.

---

## 3. Detailed Step‐by‐Step Flow

Below, each arrow or step in the figure is described in sequence (from top to bottom):

1. **Wait for Matching Process Start Trigger**  
   - Both the EV side and the EVSE side wait internally until a trigger condition indicates that SLAC matching should begin.  
   - Timers such as TP_EV_SLAC_init (for the EV) and TT_EVSE_SLAC_init (for the EVSE) are started.

2. **EV PLC Node → CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ**  
   - Once triggered, the EV PLC node sends a “CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ” broadcast request.  
   - This request announces the EV’s parameters to potential EVSE nodes and includes a unique runID.

3. **EVSE PLC Node → CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  
   - An unmatched EVSE node that is ready replies with “CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF” to the EV’s broadcast.  
   - This confirmation message includes details like M-Sound counts, a matching runID, and a time-out field (Time_Out) dictating how long the EVSE will receive M-Sounds.

4. **Timers and Response Windows**  
   - The EV uses TT_match_response to await CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF messages. If valid CNFs are received, it proceeds. Otherwise, it retries or declares failure after repeated timeouts.

5. **EV PLC Node → CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND** (multiple times)
   - After the EV obtains a valid parameter confirmation, it waits for TP_match_sequence to expire, then begins attenuation characterization by sending “CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND” messages in a short batch.  
   - Each indicates the number of M‐Sounds to transmit (NUM_SOUNDS) and includes the runID.

6. **EV PLC Node → CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND** (multiple times)
   - Following its last “CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND,” the EV sends a sequence of “CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND” messages C_EV_match_MNBC times (for example, 8 times).  
   - A decrementing counter (Cnt) goes down with each M‐Sound message. The EV typically spaces these out with TP_EV_batch_msg_interval to avoid congestion.

7. **EVSE PLC Node → CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND** (multiple times)
   - While the EV is sending M‐Sounds, the EVSE may measure and aggregate the received signals. It can send multiple “CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND” messages back to the EV if necessary.  
   - The EV receives these within TT_EV_atten_results.

8. **EVSE PLC Node → CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND**
   - After collecting or averaging enough M‐Sounds, the EVSE compiles final attenuation data and sends “CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND” to the EV.  
   - This is typically triggered once TT_EVSE_match_MNBC expires and the EVSE finishes averaging.

9. **EV PLC Node → CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP**
   - Upon receiving the final attenuation characterization message, the EV responds with “CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP,” acknowledging the data.  
   - At this point, the EV has the final measured attenuation and can decide whether the EVSE is indeed the physically connected one (i.e., “EVSE_FOUND,” “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND,” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”).

10. **Optional Validation Phase**  
   - If the EV determines it needs further certainty, it performs a validation step:  
     1. **CM_VALIDATE.REQ (Step 1)** from EV to EVSE – the EV requests the EVSE’s readiness to do a BCB toggle validation on the control pilot.  
     2. **CM_VALIDATE.CNF (Step 1)** from EVSE to EV – the EVSE states “Ready,” “Not Required,” “Not Ready,” or “Failure.”  
     3. **BCB Toggle** – If the EVSE is “Ready,” the EV toggles the battery control block for a specific time.  
     4. **CM_VALIDATE.REQ (Step 2)** from EV to EVSE – includes how long the EVSE should count toggles.  
     5. **CM_VALIDATE.CNF (Step 2)** from EVSE to EV – indicates success/failure and includes the count of toggles.  
   - The EV can confirm the physically linked EVSE if the toggles match the EV’s expectation.

11. **EV PLC Node → CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ**
   - Once the EV is confident it has identified the correct EVSE, it sends “CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ” to finalize the network join parameters.  
   - This message includes MAC addresses, the runID, and other final matching fields.

12. **EVSE PLC Node → CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF**
   - The EVSE acknowledges with “CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF,” which supplies the EV with the NMK (network membership key) or other parameters needed for a private logical network.  
   - Both sides now have the exact security and channel information.

13. **EV PLC Node ↔ EV Host** and **EVSE Host**: Key‐Setting (CM_SET_KEY)
   - The figure may show “CM_SET_KEY.REQ” from the EVSE Host to EVSE PLC node (or from the EV Host to the EV PLC node).  
   - “CM_SET_KEY.CNF” confirms that the local low‐layer module is configured with the correct NMK.

14. **Link Detected & TT_match_join**  
   - Once the EV sets its own key, it attempts to join the EVSE’s logical network. If a link is detected within TT_match_join, the process proceeds. Otherwise, the EV or EVSE decides the matching has failed and may retry.

15. **(Optional) Amplitude Map Exchange (CM_AMP_MAPREQ, CM_AMP_MAPCNF)**  
   - If either the EV or the EVSE requests a reduced transmit power or localized notched carriers, it may initiate the amplitude map exchange.  
   - “CM_AMP_MAP.REQ” is sent, followed by “CM_AMP_MAP.CNF.” If no amplitude map exchange is needed, this part is skipped.

16. **Inform Higher‐Layer Entities**  
   - Once the link is securely established, the final step is a “D-LINK_READY” indication to the higher‐layer entity (HLE) in both the EV and the EVSE. This notifies both that the HomePlug Green PHY link is active and ready for ISO 15118 application‐layer communication.

## 4. Relationships and Key Connection Points

- **EV PLC Node ↔ EVSE PLC Node**:  
  Almost all SLAC measurement messages flow between these two low‐layer communication modules. They exchange parameter sets, attenuation data, and matching confirmations.

- **EV Host ↔ EV PLC Node**:  
  The EV Host instructs or triggers the EV PLC node to start SLAC or to proceed with validation. It may also configure local amplitude maps or set keys.

- **EVSE Host ↔ EVSE PLC Node**:  
  The EVSE Host can command its low‐layer module to set a new key (e.g., CM_SET_KEY.REQ) or to confirm certain states. It also triggers the EVSE PLC node to respond after a successful matching.

- **Timers**:  
  Many timers appear in the sequence and govern when a node can give up, retry, or proceed to the next step. For example:  
  - **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**: Time for EVSE to listen for CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ after detecting state B.  
  - **TP_match_sequence**: A performance time ensuring that the next request (e.g., CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND) happens only after the prior response.  
  - **TT_match_response**: Both EV and EVSE wait up to this duration for a particular response; if it times out, they may retry or declare a failure.  
  - **TT_EV_atten_results**: EV’s time window to receive all CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND.  
  - **TT_EVSE_match_MNBC**: EVSE’s time window to collect M-Sound data and produce CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND.  
  - **TP_EV_batch_msg_interval**: Interval between consecutive messages in a batch (e.g., multiple CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND).  
  - **TT_match_join**: Maximum time allowed for the newly provided NMK/NID to form a valid link.  
  - **TT_amp_map_exchange**: Time for optional amplitude map request/response.  
  - **TP_link_ready_notification**: Performance limit to notify HLE that the data link is established.

---

## 5. Concluding Notes

- **Failure Handling**:  
  If any node fails to receive the expected messages within the specified timers or if content is invalid (e.g., invalid runID or mismatch in message definitions), the matching may be retried until certain repetition counts are reached. Ultimately, if repeated attempts fail, the matching process ends in “Unmatched” state.

- **Optional Validation**:  
  The EV is free to skip the CM_VALIDATE steps if the signal strength measurement unambiguously identifies the EVSE. If the EVSE is “Busy” or “Not Ready,” the EV can either wait and retry or attempt matching with a different EVSE (if multiple stations were discovered).

- **Amplitude Map Exchange**:  
  This may or may not be used in every session. It is only performed if either side wants to restrict transmit power further. If performed, both sides finalize an amplitude map to ensure compliance with local regulations and minimal interference.

### Final Outcome

By the end of the sequence shown in Figure A.2, the EV has:  
1. Exchanged parameters and measured attenuation with all potential EVSEs.  
2. (Optionally) Validated the correct EVSE with BCB toggles.  
3. Requested and received final matching data (NMK, NID).  
4. Joined the logical network by setting keys.  
5. Confirmed or skipped the amplitude map exchange.  
6. Indicated to higher layers that the link is ready for powerline communication.

All these steps ensure that only the physically connected EVSE is selected, avoiding interference or incorrect pairing with other EVSE nodes on the same powerline network.
