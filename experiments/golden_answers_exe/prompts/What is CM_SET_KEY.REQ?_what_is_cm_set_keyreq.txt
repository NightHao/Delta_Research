Use ONLY this information to construct a comprehensive answer.
Do not add any new information that is not present below.

TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.5.3.3 EVSE side (Context: A.9.5.3.3 EVSE side > A.9.5 Joining the logical network > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The EVSE shall configure its low-layer communciation module to the NID and NMK values sent in CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF at the latest after sending the CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF. The configuration can also be done at any time before (e.g. after unplugging of a previous EV). The configuration shall be done by sending a CM_SET_KEY.REQ.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: [V2G3-A09-103] After sending a CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF containing a NMK and a NID, the EVSE shall start its TT_match_join timer. This timer ends when the CCo detects a link in its logical network. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 2: [V2G3-A09-104] If no link is detected when the TT_match_join timer expires, the EVSE shall con- sider the matching process as FAILED. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 3: NOTE 3 If the EVSE needs to configure its NMK and NID after the CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF, it should consider that the just sent CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF might get lost and the EV will send a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ retry within TT_match_response. Within this time, the EVSE should not be blind due to the configuration process for the incoming CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ retry. (sibling of Text 1)
