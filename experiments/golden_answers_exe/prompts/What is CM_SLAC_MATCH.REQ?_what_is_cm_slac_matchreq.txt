TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.4;
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the most probable EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.3;
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_NOT_FOUND, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 5: A.9.4.3.3 EVSE side (Context: A.9.4.3.3 EVSE side > A.9.4 Logical network parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EVSE receives another CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ from the same EV, this means that the EV retransmitted its request for some reason (i.e. the CM_SLAC_MATCH. CNF was not received). The EVSE shall respond to the request again.
Text 6: A.9.1.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.1.3.2 EV side > A.9.1 Signal strength measurement – parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EVSE receives a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ with invalid content, it shall be ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.7 is invalid.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 2: After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS. Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 3: The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP]. (sibling of Text 1)

(sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 7: [V2G3-A09-20] The Average_Attenuation used for matching decision shall be calculated by the arithmetic mean of all groups in the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. To take implementation specifics into account, a weighted average may be used. When using a weighted average, the sum of the weights of all groups shall be one. (sibling of Text 1)
