Question What is ATS?: What is ATS?

Below is all the available information related to this question.
Use ONLY this information to construct a comprehensive answer.
Do not add any new information that is not present below.

TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: Abstract Test Suite
Text 2: test suite composed of abstract test cases
Text 3: The capability tests within the ATS check that the implementation has the capability of supporting the functionality described in ISO 15118-3.
Text 4: The following conditions apply in terms of test case coverage:
Text 5: — Requirements that are out of scope according to ISO 15118-5 are excluded from testing.
Text 6: — Requirements that are not explicitly tested through dedicated test cases have been covered implicitly.
Text 7: The resulting test suite coverage in this document is indicated as follows:
Text 8: X Indicates requirements that are covered in the ATS through dedicated test cases.
Text 9: I Indicates requirements that are indirectly covered through other test cases.
Text 10: P Indicates requirements that are only partially covered, i.e. some aspects are tested but not all.
Text 11: N Requirements that are not testable for the profile.
Text 12: ‐ Requirements that are not applicable for the profile.
Text 13: O Requirements that are out of scope for the profile.
Text 14: Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement
Text 15: To evaluate the conformance of a particular implementation to ISO 15118-3, an implementation has to specify its capabilities and options with respect to ISO 15118-3.
Text 16: All PICS defined in the ATS are summarized in Tables 6 to 8.
Text 17: Protocol implementation extra information for testing
Text 18: In order to ensure testability of ISO 15118‐3 requirements, additional information about the implementation is needed that is not necessarily required for conformance but for test execution.

OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
Your answer should follow these guidelines:
1. Start with an 'Overview' section that provides a concise explanation of what this concept/topic is.
2. For the related content, organize it into appropriate sections with descriptive headings based on the information available.
   - Analyze the content and group related information logically.
   - Choose section titles that best represent the information, such as 'Related Topics', 'Related Primitives', 'Configuration Requirements', etc.
   - Let the content guide your choice of section titles rather than forcing a predefined structure.
3. The structure should match the format used in technical documentation, with clear hierarchy and organization.
4. Include any relevant figures, tables, or processes mentioned in the information.
5. Be as detailed and comprehensive as possible while ONLY using the provided information.
6. In writing your answer, strictly follow the content provided in the information, and do not add any new information or make assumptions.
