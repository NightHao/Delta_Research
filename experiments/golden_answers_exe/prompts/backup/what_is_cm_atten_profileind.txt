Text 2: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to.

Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.

# Detailed Description of Figure A.11 — HomePlug Green PHY-Transmission Path Example

Below is a comprehensive description of the flow chart shown in “Figure A.11 — HomePlug Green PHY-Transmission path example with SLAC relevant attenuations and calculations.” The diagram illustrates how the Power Line Communication (PLC) signal (M-Sound, in this context) travels from the Electric Vehicle (EV) side to the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) side, with all the associated insertion losses, power spectral densities (PSDs), and measurement steps.

## 1. Entities Overview

1. **PLC node EV**  
   - Houses a Green PHY modem.  
   - Has two paths connected to the modem:  
     - Rx-Path AttnRxEV (receiving path insertion loss).  
     - Tx-Path AttnTxEV (transmitting path insertion loss).

2. **Charge cord (AttnCord)**  
   - The physical charging cable between the EV and the EVSE.  
   - It introduces its own insertion loss to the signal.

3. **PLC node EVSE**  
   - Also houses a Green PHY modem on the EVSE side.  
   - Has two paths connected to the modem:  
     - Rx-Path AttnRxEVSE (receiving path insertion loss).  
     - Tx-Path AttnTxEVSE (transmitting path insertion loss).

4. **PSD of M-Sound along the transmission path**  
   - Shows the power spectral density at various points from EV to EVSE:  
     - PSD at the EV modem transmitter output.  
     - PSD at the EV socket.  
     - PSD at the EVSE socket.  
     - PSD at the EVSE modem input.

5. **SLAC Measurement**  
   - Refers to the Signal Level Attenuation Characterization measurement.  
   - Uses a reference PSD of −50 dBm/Hz.  
   - The EVSE corrects the measured values by adding back AttnRxEVSE (its insertion loss) before reporting to the EV.

6. **Attenuation for Matching Decision**  
   - A procedure to determine the final attenuation value by comparing reported attenuation values against a reference PSD (−26 dB in the example).  
   - Averaged over all relevant carrier groups.

7. **Reported Attenuation**  
   - The final attenuation reported (e.g., “−28 dB”) is the per-carrier-group attenuation, factoring in EVSE’s internal correction.

## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)

The flow chart is read primarily from left to right (EV side to EVSE side), with a bottom branch showing how the SLAC measurement and final attenuation decisions are derived.

1. **PSD at Trncv Output (EV side)**  
   - The Green PHY modem inside the EV transmits the signal at a power spectral density of **−72 dBm/Hz**.  
   - This output is labeled “PSD of M-Sound along the transmission path from EV to EVSE.”

2. **−AttnTxEV**  
   - The transmitting path on the EV side (Tx-Path AttnTxEV) incurs an insertion loss (example: ~4 dB).  
   - After subtracting this loss, the resulting PSD at the EV socket is **−76 dBm/Hz** (the “design target”).

3. **Passing Through Charge Cord (−AttnCord)**  
   - The charge cord itself (AttnCord) further attenuates the signal.  
   - The PSD at the EVSE socket becomes **−78 dBm/Hz**.

4. **−AttnRxEVSE**  
   - On the EVSE side, the receiving path (Rx-Path AttnRxEVSE) imposes an additional insertion loss (example: ~3 dB).  
   - The PSD finally arrives at the EVSE modem input at **−81 dBm/Hz**.

5. **SLAC Measurement**  
   - The EVSE performs a SLAC measurement referencing **−50 dBm/Hz** as a baseline.  
   - The raw measurement (labeled “−31 dB”) represents how much the EVSE side sees relative to −50 dBm/Hz.

6. **Correction of Insertion Loss (AttnRxEVSE)**  
   - Since the EVSE must correct for its own internal Rx-Path loss (AttnRxEVSE), it adds back this loss value.  
   - This results in a final reported measured attenuation of **−28 dB** per carrier group.

7. **Calculations for Attenuation Measurement for Matching Decision**  
   - In parallel (shown at the bottom branch of the figure), the PSD at the EV socket (−76 dBm/Hz) is compared against a reference PSD mention (−50 dBm/Hz) with a reference offset (−26 dB).  
   - The difference is averaged over all carrier groups to get a scalar attenuation value. An example final result shown is **2 dB**.

8. **Report of Measured Attenuation**  
   - The EVSE finally reports “−28 dB” as the measured attenuation per carrier group (after the insertion-loss correction).  
   - The bottom label notes that the “Attenuation for matching decision is determined by averaging the difference between the reported attenuation values and the reference PSD over all carrier groups.”

## 3. Relation and Connection of Entities

- **EV (PLC node EV) → EV Socket**:  
  Signal originates from the EV’s Green PHY modem at −72 dBm/Hz. The “Tx-Path AttnTxEV” reduces it by a few dB (e.g., 4 dB).

- **EV Socket → Charge Cord**:  
  The EV socket outputs ~−76 dBm/Hz. The cord (AttnCord) introduces further loss, giving ~−78 dBm/Hz at the EVSE socket.

- **EVSE Socket → EVSE Modem**:  
  The signal then passes through the “Rx-Path AttnRxEVSE.” By the time it reaches the EVSE modem input, it is at ~−81 dBm/Hz.

- **SLAC Measurement Reference**:  
  The EVSE measures the signal level relative to −50 dBm/Hz. The measured result (−31 dB) is adjusted upward by the known AttnRxEVSE (3 dB in the example) to give a final reported attenuation of −28 dB.

- **Attenuation for Matching Decision**:  
  A reference of −26 dB is used to gauge how much attenuation is really observed relative to the design PSD target. An example final scalar value of 2 dB is shown, though in practice it is averaged over multiple carrier groups.

## Notes and Key Takeaways

- All PSD and attenuation values in the diagram (−72 dBm/Hz, −76 dBm/Hz, −78 dBm/Hz, −81 dBm/Hz, etc.) are examples for illustration. Real values depend on design, cables, coupling components, and actual measurement setups.  
- AttnRxEV, AttnTxEV, AttnRxEVSE, AttnTxEVSE, and AttnCord are all insertion-loss factors contributing to the overall reduction of the PLC signal from the EV modem transmitter to the EVSE modem receiver (and vice versa).  
- The SLAC procedure relies on having a known reference PSD of −50 dBm/Hz and requires the EVSE to correct for its own internal losses before reporting attenuation data back to the EV.

This completes the detailed breakdown of the figure, step-by-step, helping engineers understand precisely how the HomePlug Green PHY communication path is measured and how attenuation values are derived.

Related Information 27: In the example, the design target is to achieve a PSD at the inlet of device of −76 dBm/Hz over the spectrum. Due to insertion losses in the transmission path (AttnTxEV), the output power of the modem (−72 dBm/Hz) has to be higher to compensate the attenuation AttnTxEV. The way of measuring the PSD for the transmission path is given in A.9.4.2. (sibling of Text 7)
Related Information 28: The charge cord attenuates the HomePlug Green PHY signal by AttnCord, which leads in the example to a PSD at the counterpart socket-outlet of −78 dBm/Hz. Within the EVSE, the signal is also affected by an insertion loss (AttnRxEVSE) of the Rx path from the socket-outlet to the Green PHY modem. (sibling of Text 7)
