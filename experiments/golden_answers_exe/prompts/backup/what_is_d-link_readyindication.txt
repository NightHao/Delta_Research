Text 4: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug- in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching process (state “Matching” in Figure 11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11.

# Detailed Description of the Connection Coordination Flow Chart (Figure 3)

Below is a step-by-step explanation in **Markdown** format, intended to help engineers quickly understand every element and pathway in the flow chart. The chart corresponds to “Figure 3” in the ISO 15118‑3 documentation, specifically showing **AC EVSE** behavior supporting PnC (Plug and Charge) and EIM (External Identification Means), with the **matching process** not started before EIM completion, and the **5 % control pilot duty cycle** is applied after the vehicle plugs in.

---

## 1. Entities Overview

**From the figure and key, these entities appear:**

1. **Plug-in**  
   - The event of connecting the EV’s inlet to the EVSE’s connector.

2. **Re-init**  
   - A restart of the session (without unplugging) by applying Control Pilot state E transition (often triggered by error handling).

3. **X1 or X2 (5 %)**  
   - Control Pilot (CP) state at 5 % duty cycle (or nominally “X1” if not yet stabilized).  
   - NOTE 1: As indicated, CP state “X1” is allowed instead of “X2 (nom.)” per IEC‑3 Table 5.

4. **X2 (5 % or nom.) "Matched state" and authorization OK**  
   - A state signifying that the EV and EVSE have achieved a matched condition at CP state X2 (which can be 5 % or nominal duty cycle); authorization is validated.

5. **EIM done & matching process not started**  
   - A condition where EIM (External Identification Means) is completed, but the V2G “matching process” (high-level communication negotiation) has not yet begun.

6. **E/F (0 %)**  
   - A Control Pilot state indicating 0 % duty cycle. Typically used for error or re-initialization handling.

7. **T_step_EF**  
   - The time duration for which the system remains in control pilot states E or F (0 %), as required by certain error or transition handling.

8. **X2 (nom.)**  
   - Control Pilot state at the nominal duty cycle for AC charging (different from the 5 % duty cycle).

9. **PnC**  
   - “Plug and Charge,” meaning automatic identification/authorization of the EV without separate user action.

10. **EIM**  
   - “External Identification Means,” such as RFID or other manual authentication methods.

11. **BC (Basic Charging)**  
   - Charging controlled purely by IEC 61851‑1 signals (i.e., CP PWM duty cycle).  
   - Represented in the flow chart as “BC” or “charging controlled by IEC 61851‑1.”

12. **HLC‑C**  
   - High‑Level Communication (HLC) for charging control, typically governed by the ISO 15118 V2G communication protocol.  
   - This is shown as “HLC‑C” or “charging controlled by high-level communication.”

13. **b) EIM w. BC**  
   - A specific branch in the flow chart where EIM is used and the charging is performed with Basic Charging (IEC 61851‑1) once authorized.

14. **c) EIM w/o BC**  
   - A branch where EIM is used, but the charging control is done via High‑Level Communication (HLC‑C).

15. **d) [IEC‑1] Charging**  
   - A branch illustrating basic IEC 61851‑1 charging (without HLC‑C).  
   - NOTE 2: Indicated in the figure that branch d) is for EVs not supporting HLC‑C.

16. **V2G Setup finished**  
   - The end of the V2G (Vehicle‑to‑Grid) high‑level communication setup. After this, power transfer can begin in the chosen mode (PnC, EIM w. BC, EIM w/o BC, or plain IEC 61851‑1).

17. **Trigger condition**  
   - Noted in the legend as the condition that prompts a transition in the flow (e.g., “Plug-in,” “Re-init”).

18. **Possible procedure vs. Mandatory procedure**  
   - The figure’s arrow styles:  
     - Dotted Arrow = Possible procedure  
     - Solid Arrow = Mandatory procedure

---

## 2. Key/Notes from the Figure

- **“NOTE 1: CP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC‑3] (Table 5).”**  
  This means that shortly after plug-in, the EVSE might momentarily apply CP state X1 before transitioning to X2(nom.) or X2(5 %).  
- **“NOTE 2: Branch d) is for EVs not supporting HLC‑C.”**  
  Some EVs are incapable of high-level communication for AC charging; in that case, they can only proceed with the basic IEC 61851‑1 method, shown in branch d).

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Flow Description

Below is the sequence of steps shown in the diagram, from left to right and top to bottom.  

1. **Plug-in**  
   - The EV is connected to the EVSE.  
   - At this moment, the EVSE typically sets the Control Pilot to either **X1** or **X2 (5 %)**.

2. **Initial CP State: X1 or X2 (5 %)**  
   - According to the standard, the EVSE might start with a 5 % duty cycle to indicate a low-current or minimal power state.  
   - **In parallel**, a “Re-init” action could also lead the CP state back to **X1 or X2 (5 %)** (this can happen if an error arises and the EVSE needs to reset the session without physically unplugging).

3. **Two Parallel Paths Emerge**  

   ### Path A – “Matched State” with Authorization (Top Branch)

   3A. **X2 (5 % or nom.) "Matched state" and authorization OK**  
       - If the EV and EVSE move quickly into a matched state at X2 (either 5 % or nominal), and the EV’s authorization is confirmed (for example, via **PnC** credentials automatically), then it proceeds as follows:

   4A. **PnC**  
       - This indicates “Plug and Charge.” The EVSE instructs high-level communication for finalizing charging parameters.

   5A. **HLC‑C**  
       - The EVSE and EV exchange ISO 15118 (V2G) messages. This is mandatory if using PnC in AC-charging with HLC.

   6A. **V2G Setup finished**  
       - Once the high-level communication successfully completes, the system is ready and can begin actual power transfer under the PnC agreement.  

   *(End of Path A)*

   ### Path B – EIM Done & Matching Not Started (Middle Branch)

   3B. **EIM done & matching process not started**  
       - The EIM process (e.g., scanning an RFID card) is finished, but the V2G “matching” session has not begun.  
       - The EVSE transitions to an error or reset state on the Control Pilot:

   4B. **E/F (0 %)**  
       - The duty cycle is driven to 0 %. This is an error/reset state or a neutral state forcing the EV to stop momentarily.

   5B. **T_step_EF**  
       - The EVSE remains in CP state E or F for a required duration (T_step_EF). This wait is mandatory before re-enabling a normal charging state.

   6B. **X2 (nom.)**  
       - After T_step_EF, the EVSE sets the duty cycle to the nominal level (X2). This indicates an intent to supply standard AC current.  

   From **X2 (nom.)**, we see three sub-branches:

   - **b) EIM w. BC**  
     7b. The “b)” label indicates “EIM with Basic Charging.” Once the system is at X2(nom.), the EV can start charging based solely on **IEC 61851‑1**.  
     8b. **BC** is used (the PWM duty cycle signals the requested current).  
     9b. **V2G Setup finished** (here, it effectively means no high-level comm is used for controlling power or has ended).  
     10b. Charging proceeds with BC.

   - **c) EIM w/o BC**  
     7c. The “c)” label indicates “EIM without Basic Charging,” meaning the EV and EVSE do use **HLC‑C** (ISO 15118 high-level communication) to regulate charging.  
     8c. **HLC‑C** is started. The standard’s V2G messages help orchestrate the charging session.  
     9c. **V2G Setup finished.**  
     10c. Charging now occurs under high-level communications, with EIM credentials having authorized it.

   - **d) [IEC‑1] Charging**  
     7d. The “d)” label references **IEC 61851‑1**-only charging. **NOTE 2** states that this branch is used by EVs that do **not** support HLC‑C.  
     8d. The EVSE continues in Basic Charging mode with the nominal duty cycle on the Control Pilot.  
     9d. The EV charges following **IEC 61851‑1** specifications.  

   *(End of Paths B, b), c), and d) )*

---

## 4. Relationship and Connection of Entities

- **Trigger conditions (“Plug-in” / “Re-init”)**: These conditions cause the CP state to go to **X1 or X2 (5 %)**. Re-init is typically an internal reset without physical disconnection.  
- **Control Pilot States (X1, X2, E, F)**: These represent distinct duty-cycle signals sent by the EVSE to the EV.  
- **EIM or PnC**:  
  - **PnC** automatically authorizes the EV if it supports the ISO 15118 plug-and-charge certificate exchange.  
  - **EIM** involves an external user action (e.g., RFID card).  
- **HLC‑C** vs. **BC**:  
  - **HLC‑C** stands for “High‑Level Communication Controlled” charging, governed by ISO 15118 messages.  
  - **BC** stands for “Basic Charging,” governed by IEC 61851‑1 duty cycle alone.  
- **Matching Process**: The step where the EV and EVSE exchange messages to confirm that advanced communication is possible and desired (via HLC‑C). In the figure, if that process is “not started” before EIM is done, the EVSE is shown forcing a short E/F(0 %) state before rejoining the nominal X2.  
- **T_step_EF**: A defined time to remain at 0 % duty cycle for transitional or error recovery steps.  

---

## 5. Extras / Notes

- **NOTE 1**: The chart allows CP State X1 as an alternative to X2(nom.) in early or transitional steps, aligning with IEC standards.  
- **NOTE 2**: The “d)” branch specifically caters to EVs that cannot handle ISO 15118 high-level communication. They will remain in IEC 61851‑1 basic mode.  
- **Mandatory vs. Possible Procedures**:  
  - Solid arrows are steps that must occur according to the standard if the conditions apply.  
  - Dashed or dotted arrows are possible transitions depending on EV/EVSE capabilities.  

---

### Summary

In essence, **Figure 3** shows how an **AC EVSE** can handle different authorization scenarios (**PnC** or **EIM**) and how the system either proceeds into **high-level communication** (HLC‑C) or stays with **basic IEC 61851‑1** charging. The *matching process* for ISO 15118 can begin once the EV is at a suitable control pilot state (X2). If the EV does **not** support HLC‑C, it will remain at nominal duty cycle X2 and proceed with basic AC charging (branch **d**). For an EV that does support HLC‑C, it can either do **PnC** (branch **a**) or **EIM** (branches **b/c**) with high-level communication or fallback to BC if HLC fails.

All paths ensure that the EVSE and EV coordinate on CP states (X1, X2, E/F with 0 %) to manage transitions (like resets or error states) before the final charging mode is achieved.

Text 5: 9.1 Overview (Context: 9.1 Overview > 9 Matching EV — EVSE process > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - Any transition from the state “Matching” triggers a call of the primitive D-LINK_READY.indication to indicate a successful or failed data-link setup.

# Detailed Description of Figure 10 — EV Point of View (Matching Process)

Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the flowchart. The diagram illustrates how an Electric Vehicle (EV) determines the correct Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) connection (i.e., “matching”) based on discovery, signal strength measurements, possible validation, and ultimately setting up or failing to set up a data link.

---

## 1. List of Key Entities in the Figure

1. **Entering matching process**  
   - Represents the beginning of the procedure once the EV is ready to identify which EVSE it is physically connected to.

2. **Discovery of the connected communication nodes**  
   - The EV discovers all communication nodes (EVSEs) detected on the physical link.

3. **Signal strength measurement**  
   - The EV measures signal strength metrics from all discovered communication nodes.  
   - “Signal Strength Measurement is a value range indication within the matching process.”

4. **Signal strength analysis**  
   - The EV analyzes the measured signal strength to determine how strongly the EVSE’s signals are received.

5. **Low signal attenuation**  
   - Indicates a strong signal measurement.  
   - If the analysis confirms a single strong connection, the result can be “EVSE_FOUND.”

6. **Ambiguous result (multiple EVSE’s, uncertain signal strength)**  
   - The EV sees more than one possible candidate or uncertain measurement.  
   - Proceeds with the interim status “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND.”

7. **High signal attenuation**  
   - Indicates a weak signal.  
   - If the analysis indicates no suitable EVSE, the result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”

8. **Result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   - The outcome that the EV confirms exactly one matching EVSE based on the signal measurement.

9. **Result is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”**  
   - The outcome that the EV sees a possible match but cannot fully confirm. A validation step might be needed.

10. **Result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
    - The outcome that the EV determines no valid EVSE is connected.

11. **Declared result is “EVSE_FOUND” / “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” / “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
    - Refers to the EV deciding or declaring the final outcome after possibly applying use-case-based rules.  
    - For “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND,” the EV may treat that result as either “EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND,” depending on scenario.

12. **optional**  
    - Indicates that certain paths (e.g., additional validation) might be skipped according to the configuration or use-case definition.

13. **Validation of matching decision**  
    - An optional or necessary process (depending on the result and the system requirements) to confirm physically that the EV is indeed connected to the intended EVSE.  
    - Can involve “BCB-Toggle” sequences on the control pilot line if the discovery result was ambiguous.

14. **Validation result? (found / not found)**  
    - After attempting validation, the EV either confirms or rejects the EVSE.  
    - If confirmed → proceed to network setup.  
    - If rejected → proceed to “next EVSE” or declare no link.

15. **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  
    - If more than one EVSE was discovered and not yet validated, the EV can continue validating in sequence.

16. **next EVSE**  
    - The EV moves to another candidate EVSE and repeats the validation step.

17. **Setup logical network**  
    - If the EV is satisfied with the discovered/validated EVSE, it sets up the logical (data link) communication network with that EVSE.

18. **Data link established?**  
    - Checks whether the EV has successfully established the data link (i.e., the communication session and all necessary transport layers).

19. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)**  
    - Indicates to higher-layer entities (HLE) that a data link is set up (matching is successful).  
    - From here, upper layers continue the binding process outlined in ISO 15118-3.

20. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)**  
    - Indicates that no valid data link is available (matching has failed).  
    - The process can exit, and higher layers are notified that no link was established.

21. **Exit matching process with success / failure**  
    - Final outcome: the EV is either matched or not matched to an EVSE.

22. **NOTE**  
    - “Error handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.”  

---

## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)

1. **Entering matching process**  
   The EV transitions into the matching phase (often triggered by a control pilot transition to an active charging state).

2. **Discovery of the connected communication nodes**  
   - The EV enumerates all communication nodes visible on the physical link.  
   - Multiple EVSEs may be detected (e.g., in scenarios with cross-talk).

3. **Signal strength measurement**  
   - The EV measures how strongly each communication node’s signal is received.

4. **Signal strength analysis**  
   - The EV compares measured signals. Three possible outcomes:  
     a) **Low signal attenuation** → strong signal from one node.  
     b) **Ambiguous result** → multiple nodes with uncertain or similarly strong signals.  
     c) **High signal attenuation** → no suitable (or extremely weak) signals.

5. **Branching into three results**  
   - If **low signal attenuation** is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_FOUND.”**  
   - If **ambiguous** measurement is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND.”**  
   - If **high signal attenuation** is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”**

6. **Result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   - Optionally, the EV may do a sanity/validation check (depending on the scenario).  
   - Otherwise, it can declare final result as “EVSE_FOUND” and proceed.

   **Declared result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   → Next step: **Setup logical network**.

7. **Result is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”**  
   - The EV might treat it as “EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND,” or it can continue with an actual **Validation of matching decision**.  
   - If it decides not to validate further (per system rules), it may directly set “Declared result is ‘EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND’” and treat it accordingly.  
   - Otherwise, proceed to the next diamond: **Validation of matching decision**.

8. **Result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
   - If the EV cannot identify a valid EVSE, or the signal is too weak to be recognized, the EV declares “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”  
   - **Declared result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”**  
   - This immediately leads to the EV calling **D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** and exiting the process (with failure).

9. **Validation of matching decision** (found on the “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” path or optionally on the “EVSE_FOUND” path)  
   - The EV requests (and performs) additional confirmation with the EVSE (for instance, using the control pilot “BCB-Toggle” procedure mentioned in Clause 9.4).  
   - **Validation result?**  
     1. **found**: The EV confirms the EVSE is correct. Proceed to “Setup logical network.”  
     2. **not found**: The EV rejects this EVSE, checks if there is a **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  
        - If **yes**, go to **next EVSE** and repeat.  
        - If **no**, proceed to “Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)” (failure).

10. **Setup logical network**  
    - Once certain of the correct EVSE, the EV sets up the low-level communication (logical network).  
    - **Data link established?**  
      - If **yes** → **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)** → exit with success.  
      - If **no** → **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** → exit with failure.

11. **Exit matching process**  
    - Either as a success (the EV is matched and ready for higher-layer communication) or as a failure (no valid link or incorrect EVSE discovered).

12. **NOTE**  
    - “Error handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.” The figure omits certain fallback or error paths (e.g., hardware faults) that are described in Annex A.9.8 in the standard.

## 3. Relation and Connection Among Entities

1. **EV** – The primary actor performing discovery, measurement, and analysis.  
2. **Communication Nodes** (EVSEs) – Possible candidates that the EV might be physically attached to.  
3. **Signal Strength Measurement** – Core step for determining whether the EV has a strong enough link to confirm “EVSE_FOUND,” or if there is ambiguity (“EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”), or if no match can be made (“EVSE_NOT_FOUND”).  
4. **Validation Process** – A separate (optional or required) mechanism that uses control pilot line toggles to double-check the physical wiring.  
5. **Logical Network Setup** – The bridging or data-layer step established once the EV confidently decides on an EVSE.  
6. **D-LINK_READY.ind** – The primitive called to indicate either a successful link or a failed link to the higher layers.

---

## 4. Additional Notes from ISO 15118-3

- **Under ambiguous conditions** (“EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”), an EV may ask the EVSE to confirm the connection via a separate pilot-line validation.  
- **Error handling** is largely omitted in Figure 10; full details appear in Annex A.9.8.  
- **Any transition**—whether success or failure—results in calling D-LINK_READY.IND to notify higher layers.  
- **According to Annex 9.5**, once the logical network is successfully set up, the status changes to “Matched” and upper-layer protocols (e.g., TLS, V2G messages) can begin binding.

### Conclusion

Figure 10 (EV point of view) outlines how the EV:  
1) **Discovers** possible EVSE nodes,  
2) **Measures** and **analyzes** each node’s signal strength,  
3) **Determines** whether a single, multiple, or zero EVSEs are valid matches,  
4) **Optionally validates** ambiguous results,  
5) **Sets up** a logical network with the matched EVSE, and  
6) **Exits** by either calling “D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)” for success or “D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)” for failure.

This step-by-step process ensures the EV consistently identifies the correct EVSE in multi-charger environments and starts a reliable higher-level communication session for the charging process.

Related Information 13: Any loss of the control pilot or a request from HLE leads to a reset to state “Unmatched”. (sibling of Text 4)
Contextual Information 8: 9.1 Overview (ancestor of Text 4)
Related Information 14: Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug- in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching process (state “Matching” in Figure 11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 15: [V2G3-A09-111] If a low-layer communication module needs to request an amplitude map exchange from the counterpart device, the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ shall be sent within TP_amp_map_exchange. The timer TP_amp_map_exchange shall be started with the detection of other stations in the current logical network after the SLAC_ MATCH exchange. (sibling of Text 7)
Related Information 16: [V2G3-A09-112] If a low-layer communication module has sent a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ but does not receive a valid CM_AMP_MAP.CNF within the max(TT_match_response), it shall retransmit the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ. The timer shall be restarted with any retry. A maximum of C_EV_match_retry retransmissions shall be performed. If after these retransmissions the low-layer communication module has not received valid response within max(TT_match_response), the matching process shall be considered as FAILED. (sibling of Text 7)
Related Information 17: [V2G3-A09-113] If a low-layer communication module receives a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ with invalid content, it shall be ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.9 is invalid. (sibling of Text 7)

Related Information 20: [V2G3-A09-115] After receiving a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ within TT_amp_map_exchange, a low-layer communication module shall answer with a CM_AMP_MAP.CNF within TP_match_ response. The timer TT_amp_map_exchange shall be started with the detection of other stations in the current logical network. (sibling of Text 7)
Related Information 21: [V2G3-A09-116] If the requested node receives another CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, this means that the counterpart station retransmitted its request for some reason (i.e. the CM_AMP_ MAP.CNF was not received); the requested node shall respond to the request again. (sibling of Text 7)
Related Information 22: [V2G3-A09-117] If the timer TT_amp_map_exchange expires without receiving a CM_AMP_MAP. REQ from the counterpart low-layer communication module and without sending a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, the D-LINK_READY.indication (link established) shall be sent to higher layers. (sibling of Text 7)
