TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: 3.16 logical network (Context: 3.16 logical network > 3 Terms and definitions > Road vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — Part 3: Physical and data link layer requirements) - set of low-layer communication stations which use the same network key

Text 7: A.9.4.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.4.1 Functional description > A.9.4 Logical network parameter exchange > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - [V2G3-A09-92] At any time an EVSE switches to a private logical network, the local NMK shall be set per random value to ensure a unique logical network. The configuration of the NMK on EVSE side shall be done with sending a CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF MME or at anytime before.
