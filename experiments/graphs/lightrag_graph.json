Published in 2015, ISO 15118-3 focuses on the physical and data link layer requirements essential for secure and efficient communication between electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSE). This standard encompasses various aspects including the setup of logical networks, EMC requirements, performance times, timeouts, calibration of power levels, and charging profiles pertinent to EVCC (Electric Vehicle Communication Controller) and SECC (Supply Equipment Communication Controller) systems.\n\nISO 15118-3 defines the procedures and protocols needed for these layers to support high-level communication across the EVSE and EVs, facilitating a standardized approach to conductive charging systems for electric vehicles. This part of the ISO 15118 standard also ensures that the communication interface between EVs and charging stations (V2G) is reliable, covering message exchanges and other relevant communication protocols.",

It is primarily a request message sent by the EV to initiate parameter exchange and start the matching process necessary for signal strength measurements. This message triggers specific actions and starts a new matching process within the evaluation phase.\n\nThe message type \"CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ\" is defined in the ISO 15118-5:2018(E) standard and is used for requesting parameters during the SLAC process. It is a crucial part of both the technical communication protocol and the testing procedures where it indicates specific parameters and a valid runID that need to be checked by the Test System. The message is used during various test cases, and it must include valid parameters and a runID. \n\nThe low-layer communication module on the EV side should not respond to this message, emphasizing its role as an outgoing request from the EV.

It is frequently mentioned within the context of ISO test cases, particularly those related to ISO 15118 standards, as well as other standards such as IEC 61851-1.\n\nEVCC's responsibilities encompass handling communication protocols, ensuring proper state changes, and monitoring during the charging process. It is involved in various testing requirements and validations, including internal state and timing tests, black box test configurations, and the Attenuation Characterization process for communication message management. Moreover, the EVCC interacts with the Supply Equipment Communication Controller (SECC) to validate requirements and execute several test functions.\n\nThis component is integral to the testing and implementation of communication standards, contributing to the compliance and proper functioning of electric vehicle charging systems. Frequently termed as the system under test (SUT), the EVCC is pivotal for managing the communication between the EV and the charging infrastructure, ensuring reliable and efficient energy transfer during charging.",

It is prominently mentioned in multiple test case descriptions and is integral to the establishment of a new AVLN in V2G communication sessions. \n\nThe GoodCase Procedure ensures proper execution and message handling by the Test System, particularly focusing on the validation of the communication process and adherence to protocols. It encompasses various scenarios, including the execution of validation tests and sending specific messages, such as CM_VALIDATE.REQ, to test compliance. The procedure also includes testing without SLAC validation and involves parameters such as a 5% duty cycle and specific timing delays during electric vehicle communication tests.\n\nThis methodology not only checks for the correct operation of SECC systems but also ensures that systems meet performance expectations under normal operating conditions. By employing the GoodCase Procedure, the Test System thoroughly evaluates system behaviors to confirm proper functionality and protocol adherence, thereby validating the success and compliance of the communication steps involved.",

It is also tested for its performance in SLAC (Signal Level Attenuation Characterization) protocol validations, amplitude map exchanges, and GoodCase procedures. The testing aims to verify that the SUT sends valid messages and parameters, complies with specified protocols, and adheres to the required standards during state changes and process initiations.\n\nAdditionally, the SUT is responsible for executing different steps during V2G communication sessions as described in the test cases. This includes monitoring its responses to withstanding timeouts, meeting specific requirements, and sending appropriate confirmation messages. The overall goal of testing the SUT is to ensure that it accurately follows the defined communication protocols and standards, thereby confirming its readiness for practical applications.",
