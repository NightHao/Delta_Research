The figure involves four principal entities:\n1. **EV Host**  \n2. **EV PLC Node** (the low\u2010layer communication module on the EV side)  \n3. **EVSE PLC Node** (the low\u2010layer communication module on the EVSE side)  \n4. **EVSE Host**  \n\nSeveral timers are used throughout (e.g., TT_match_response, TT_EVSE_match_MNBC, TT_EV_atten_results, etc.), and numerous message exchanges take place to coordinate the matching, measurement, validation, and eventual linking of the EV and the EVSE. The main goal is to ensure that the EV joins the EVSE\u2019s HomePlug Green\u00a0PHY network only if the correct EVSE is physically connected.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Shown in the Figure\n\n1. **EV\u00a0Host**  \n   \u2022 Triggers and manages part of the matching and SLAC processes on the vehicle side.  \n   \u2022 May also participate in the amplitude map exchange and final notifications to higher layers.\n\n2. **EV\u00a0PLC\u00a0Node**  \n   \u2022 The low\u2010layer communication module in the EV.  \n   \u2022 Sends/receives SLAC\u2010related messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ), handles attenuation measurement steps (CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP), and initiates validation or matching requests.\n\n3. **EVSE\u00a0PLC\u00a0Node**  \n   \u2022 The low\u2010layer communication module in the charging station.  \n   \u2022 Responds to the EV\u2019s messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF), performs attenuation measurements, and returns results (e.g., CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND).  \n   \u2022 May also carry out a validation procedure upon EV requests and send final match confirmations.\n\n4. **EVSE\u00a0Host**  \n   \u2022 Controls higher-level aspects on the EVSE side, including key sets (CM_SET_KEY.REQ) or other logic.  \n   \u2022 May provide triggers to begin or end the matching process.\n\n---\n\n## 2. High\u2010Level Flow Overview\n\nFigure\u00a0A.2 shows the continuation of the overall HomePlug Green\u00a0PHY matching process, focusing on:  \n- Attenuation measurements using M\u2010Sound messages and collecting CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND data.  \n- Final attenuation confirmations (CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND and CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP).  \n- (Optionally) Validation steps (CM_VALIDATE) with possible BCB toggles.  \n- Network matching confirmation (CM_SLAC_MATCH).  \n- Key setting (CM_SET_KEY) on both sides.  \n- Detection of the link and optional amplitude map exchange (CM_AMP_MAPREQ and CM_AMP_MAPCNF).  \n- Final \u201cD_LINK_READY\u201d notification to the higher layers once the link is established.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Detailed Step\u2010by\u2010Step Flow\n\nBelow, each arrow or step in the figure is described in sequence (from top to bottom):\n\n1. **Wait for Matching Process Start Trigger**  \n   - Both the EV side and the EVSE side wait internally until a trigger condition indicates that SLAC matching should begin.  \n   - Timers such as TP_EV_SLAC_init (for the EV) and TT_EVSE_SLAC_init (for the EVSE) are started.\n\n2. **EV PLC Node \u2192 CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ**  \n   - Once triggered, the EV PLC node sends a \u201cCM_SLAC_PARM.REQ\u201d broadcast request.  \n   - This request announces the EV\u2019s parameters to potential EVSE nodes and includes a unique runID.\n\n3. **EVSE PLC Node \u2192 CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  \n   - An unmatched EVSE node that is ready replies with \u201cCM_SLAC_PARM.CNF\u201d to the EV\u2019s broadcast.  \n   - This confirmation message includes details like M-Sound counts, a matching runID, and a time-out field (Time_Out) dictating how long the EVSE will receive M-Sounds.\n\n4. **Timers and Response Windows**  \n   - The EV uses TT_match_response to await CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF messages. If valid CNFs are received, it proceeds. Otherwise, it retries or declares failure after repeated timeouts.\n\n5. **EV PLC Node \u2192 CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND** (multiple times)\n   - After the EV obtains a valid parameter confirmation, it waits for TP_match_sequence to expire, then begins attenuation characterization by sending \u201cCM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND\u201d messages in a short batch.  \n   - Each indicates the number of M\u2010Sounds to transmit (NUM_SOUNDS) and includes the runID.\n\n6. **EV PLC Node \u2192 CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND** (multiple times)\n   - Following its last \u201cCM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND,\u201d the EV sends a sequence of \u201cCM_MNBC_SOUND.IND\u201d messages C_EV_match_MNBC times (for example, 8 times).  \n   - A decrementing counter (Cnt) goes down with each M\u2010Sound message. The EV typically spaces these out with TP_EV_batch_msg_interval to avoid congestion.\n\n7. **EVSE PLC Node \u2192 CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND** (multiple times)\n   - While the EV is sending M\u2010Sounds, the EVSE may measure and aggregate the received signals. It can send multiple \u201cCM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND\u201d messages back to the EV if necessary.  \n   - The EV receives these within TT_EV_atten_results.\n\n8. **EVSE PLC Node \u2192 CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND**\n   - After collecting or averaging enough M\u2010Sounds, the EVSE compiles final attenuation data and sends \u201cCM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND\u201d to the EV.  \n   - This is typically triggered once TT_EVSE_match_MNBC expires and the EVSE finishes averaging.\n\n9. **EV PLC Node \u2192 CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP**\n   - Upon receiving the final attenuation characterization message, the EV responds with \u201cCM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP,\u201d acknowledging the data.  \n   - At this point, the EV has the final measured attenuation and can decide whether the EVSE is indeed the physically connected one (i.e., \u201cEVSE_FOUND,\u201d \u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND,\u201d or \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND\u201d).\n\n10. **Optional Validation Phase**  \n   - If the EV determines it needs further certainty, it performs a validation step:  \n     1. **CM_VALIDATE.REQ (Step 1)** from EV to EVSE \u2013 the EV requests the EVSE\u2019s readiness to do a BCB toggle validation on the control pilot.  \n     2. **CM_VALIDATE.CNF (Step 1)** from EVSE to EV \u2013 the EVSE states \u201cReady,\u201d \u201cNot Required,\u201d \u201cNot Ready,\u201d or \u201cFailure.\u201d  \n     3. **BCB Toggle** \u2013 If the EVSE is \u201cReady,\u201d the EV toggles the battery control block for a specific time.  \n     4. **CM_VALIDATE.REQ (Step 2)** from EV to EVSE \u2013 includes how long the EVSE should count toggles.  \n     5. **CM_VALIDATE.CNF (Step 2)** from EVSE to EV \u2013 indicates success/failure and includes the count of toggles.  \n   - The EV can confirm the physically linked EVSE if the toggles match the EV\u2019s expectation.\n\n11. **EV PLC Node \u2192 CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ**\n   - Once the EV is confident it has identified the correct EVSE, it sends \u201cCM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ\u201d to finalize the network join parameters.  \n   - This message includes MAC addresses, the runID, and other final matching fields.\n\n12. **EVSE PLC Node \u2192 CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF**\n   - The EVSE acknowledges with \u201cCM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF,\u201d which supplies the EV with the NMK (network membership key) or other parameters needed for a private logical network.  \n   - Both sides now have the exact security and channel information.\n\n13. **EV PLC Node \u2194 EV Host** and **EVSE Host**: Key\u2010Setting (CM_SET_KEY)\n   - The figure may show \u201cCM_SET_KEY.REQ\u201d from the EVSE Host to EVSE PLC node (or from the EV Host to the EV PLC node).  \n   - \u201cCM_SET_KEY.CNF\u201d confirms that the local low\u2010layer module is configured with the correct NMK.\n\n14. **Link Detected & TT_match_join**  \n   - Once the EV sets its own key, it attempts to join the EVSE\u2019s logical network. If a link is detected within TT_match_join, the process proceeds. Otherwise, the EV or EVSE decides the matching has failed and may retry.\n\n15. **(Optional) Amplitude Map Exchange (CM_AMP_MAPREQ, CM_AMP_MAPCNF)**  \n   - If either the EV or the EVSE requests a reduced transmit power or localized notched carriers, it may initiate the amplitude map exchange.  \n   - \u201cCM_AMP_MAP.REQ\u201d is sent, followed by \u201cCM_AMP_MAP.CNF.\u201d If no amplitude map exchange is needed, this part is skipped.\n\n16. **Inform Higher\u2010Layer Entities**  \n   - Once the link is securely established, the final step is a \u201cD-LINK_READY\u201d indication to the higher\u2010layer entity (HLE) in both the EV and the EVSE. This notifies both that the HomePlug Green\u00a0PHY link is active and ready for ISO\u00a015118 application\u2010layer communication.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relationships and Key Connection Points\n\n- **EV PLC Node \u2194 EVSE PLC Node**:  \n  Almost all SLAC measurement messages flow between these two low\u2010layer communication modules. They exchange parameter sets, attenuation data, and matching confirmations.\n\n- **EV Host \u2194 EV PLC Node**:  \n  The EV Host instructs or triggers the EV PLC node to start SLAC or to proceed with validation. It may also configure local amplitude maps or set keys.\n\n- **EVSE Host \u2194 EVSE PLC Node**:  \n  The EVSE Host can command its low\u2010layer module to set a new key (e.g., CM_SET_KEY.REQ) or to confirm certain states. It also triggers the EVSE PLC node to respond after a successful matching.\n\n- **Timers**:  \n  Many timers appear in the sequence and govern when a node can give up, retry, or proceed to the next step. For example:  \n  - **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**: Time for EVSE to listen for CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ after detecting state\u00a0B.  \n  - **TP_match_sequence**: A performance time ensuring that the next request (e.g., CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND) happens only after the prior response.  \n  - **TT_match_response**: Both EV and EVSE wait up to this duration for a particular response; if it times out, they may retry or declare a failure.  \n  - **TT_EV_atten_results**: EV\u2019s time window to receive all CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND.  \n  - **TT_EVSE_match_MNBC**: EVSE\u2019s time window to collect M-Sound data and produce CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND.  \n  - **TP_EV_batch_msg_interval**: Interval between consecutive messages in a batch (e.g., multiple CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND).  \n  - **TT_match_join**: Maximum time allowed for the newly provided NMK/NID to form a valid link.  \n  - **TT_amp_map_exchange**: Time for optional amplitude map request/response.  \n  - **TP_link_ready_notification**: Performance limit to notify HLE that the data link is established.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Concluding Notes\n\n- **Failure Handling**:  \n  If any node fails to receive the expected messages within the specified timers or if content is invalid (e.g., invalid runID or mismatch in message definitions), the matching may be retried until certain repetition counts are reached. Ultimately, if repeated attempts fail, the matching process ends in \u201cUnmatched\u201d state.\n\n- **Optional Validation**:  \n  The EV is free to skip the CM_VALIDATE steps if the signal strength measurement unambiguously identifies the EVSE. If the EVSE is \u201cBusy\u201d or \u201cNot Ready,\u201d the EV can either wait and retry or attempt matching with a different EVSE (if multiple stations were discovered).\n\n- **Amplitude Map Exchange**:  \n  This may or may not be used in every session. It is only performed if either side wants to restrict transmit power further. If performed, both sides finalize an amplitude map to ensure compliance with local regulations and minimal interference.\n\n---\n\n### Final Outcome\n\nBy the end of the sequence shown in Figure\u00a0A.2, the EV has:  \n1. Exchanged parameters and measured attenuation with all potential EVSEs.  \n2. (Optionally) Validated the correct EVSE with BCB toggles.  \n3. Requested and received final matching data (NMK, NID).  \n4. Joined the logical network by setting keys.  \n5. Confirmed or skipped the amplitude map exchange.  \n6. Indicated to higher layers that the link is ready for powerline communication.\n\nAll these steps ensure that only the physically connected EVSE is selected, avoiding interference or incorrect pairing with other EVSE nodes on the same powerline network.",

Overall Structure of the Diagram\n\nThe figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):\n\n1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** \u2013 Represented by the ISO\u202f15118\u20113 standard.  \n2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** \u2013 Indicated by the \u201cV2G standardized service primitive interface,\u201d which bridges ISO\u202f15118\u20113 with the higher-layer protocols.  \n3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** \u2013 Represented by the ISO\u202f15118\u20112 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO\u202f15118\u20111 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  \n\nWithin the big outer box labeled \u201cVehicle-to-Grid communication,\u201d two standards are highlighted:\n- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)\n- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)\n\nAt the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description\n\n### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 1 Physical.\u201d  \n- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium\u2014e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO\u202f15118\u20113** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).\n\n### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 2 Data link.\u201d  \n- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO\u202f15118\u20113** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable \u201clow-layer\u201d communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).\n\nBoth Layer\u202f1 and Layer\u202f2 appear inside the \u201cISO\u202f15118\u20113\u201d box. They are the core focus of \u201cPart 3\u201d of the ISO\u202f15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized \u201cpipe\u201d for higher-layer messages.\n\n### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cV2G standardized service primitive interface.\u201d  \n- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO\u202f15118\u20112 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO\u202f15118\u20113.  \n- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main \u201chandshake\u201d region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.\n\n### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 3 Network.\u201d  \n- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  \n- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO\u202f15118\u20112** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).\n\n### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 4 Transport.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO\u202f15118\u20112**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.\n\n### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 5 Session.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO\u202f15118\u20112** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).\n\n### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 6 Presentation.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer\u2014handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO\u202f15118\u20112** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.\n\n### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cOSI layer 7 Application.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  \n- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO\u202f15118\u20112**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.\n\n### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cVehicle-to-Grid communication.\u201d  \n- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of \u201cV2G\u201d communication from an OSI perspective\u2014covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:\n  1. **ISO 15118\u20111** (General information and use-case definition)  \n  2. **ISO 15118\u20112** (Network and application protocol requirements)\n\n  Where **ISO 15118\u20111** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118\u20112** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.\n\n### 3.10 ISO\u202f15118\u20111\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cISO 15118\u20111.\u201d  \n- **Caption**: \u201cGeneral information and use-case definition.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (\u20112 and \u20113).\n\n### 3.11 ISO\u202f15118\u20112\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cISO 15118\u20112.\u201d  \n- **Caption**: \u201cNetwork and application protocol requirements.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118\u20111 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.\n\n### 3.12 ISO\u202f15118\u20113\n- **Name in Diagram**: \u201cISO 15118\u20113.\u201d  \n- **Caption**: \u201cPhysical layer and Data link layer requirements.\u201d  \n- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118\u20112) can function as intended.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relationship and Connections\n\n1. **ISO\u202f15118\u20113 \u2192 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  \n   - ISO\u202f15118\u20113 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.\n\n2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface \u2192 ISO\u202f15118\u20112**  \n   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO\u202f15118\u20112 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.\n\n3. **ISO\u202f15118\u20112 \u2192 OSI Layers 3\u20137**  \n   - ISO\u202f15118\u20112 \u201clives\u201d across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.\n\n4. **ISO\u202f15118\u20111 \u2192 Overall**  \n   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO\u202f15118\u20111 supplies the conceptual building blocks\u2014e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions\u2014that shape the services needed in layers 1\u20137.\n\n5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  \n   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO\u202f15118\u20111 and ISO\u202f15118\u20112 is conceptually the V2G communication \u201cstack,\u201d reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO\u202f15118\u20113.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How the Diagram \u201cFlows\u201d\nWhile not a classic procedural \u201cflowchart,\u201d the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:\n\n1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  \n2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  \n3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  \n4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3\u20137)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  \n\nEach standard (ISO\u202f15118\u20111, ISO\u202f15118\u20112, and ISO\u202f15118\u20113) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers\n\n- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO\u202f15118\u20113) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO\u202f15118\u20112), with ISO\u202f15118\u20111 providing conceptual underpinnings.  \n- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  \n- **Interoperability**: Each layer\u2019s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor\u2014covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO\u202f15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.",

A protocol within 6LoWPAN to help connect and configure new nodes in the PLC mesh or network environment.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Connections and Relationships**\n\n- **Physical layer** \u2194 **PHY Mgt**  \n  The OFDM PHY layer (IEEE Std 1901.2\u2122 \u2013 2013) is controlled/configured by the PHY management block, which sets physical transmission parameters.\n\n- **Physical layer** \u2192 **IEEE Std 1901.2\u2122 \u2013 2013 G3-PLC OFDM MAC layer**  \n  The MAC layer receives raw frames from the physical layer and adds addressing, channel-access rules, and error checking.\n\n- **MAC Mgt** \u2194 **IEEE Std 1901.2\u2122 \u2013 2013 G3-PLC OFDM MAC layer**  \n  The MAC management entity controls or monitors MAC-related parameters (e.g., network IDs, security).\n\n- **IEEE Std 1901.2\u2122 \u2013 2013 G3-PLC OFDM MAC layer** \u2192 **6LoWPAN convergence layer**  \n  The MAC layer passes packets (frames) up to the 6LoWPAN layer, which then applies fragmentation, compression, etc.\n\n- **6LoWPAN Mgt** \u2194 **6LoWPAN convergence layer**  \n  Provides configuration and management for the 6LoWPAN features such as EAP-PSK authentication, bootstrap, compression rules, and fragmentation.\n\n- **6LoWPAN convergence layer** \u2192 **Data link data SAP**  \n  Data that has been processed (fragmented/compressed/authenticated) can be handed to higher layers via the Data link data SAP using standardized primitives (DATA-LINK_SEND, DATA-LINK_RECEIVE, etc.).\n\n- **Data link control SAP**  \n  Offers a control and status interface to manage the link (e.g., link setup, teardown, status inquiries).

Ultimately, the stack ensures IPv6-based communication over power lines using G3-PLC.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Figure B.3** illustrates how **G3-PLC** provides both **physical (PHY)** and **data link (MAC + 6LoWPAN)** functions in ISO 15118-3.  \n- **6LoWPAN** is essential for supporting IPv6, authentication, and efficient header handling (fragmentation/compression).  \n- **Data link SAP** interfaces (Data and Control) allow upper layers to send data or manage link status.  \n- **Management entities** (PHY Mgt, MAC Mgt, 6LoWPAN Mgt) coordinate each layer\u2019s configuration and operational parameters.\n\nThis layered approach ensures a robust, standardized mechanism for vehicle-to-grid and related power line communication scenarios.",

Entities Overview\n\n**From the figure and key, these entities appear:**\n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   - The event of connecting the EV\u2019s inlet to the EVSE\u2019s connector.\n\n2. **Re-init**  \n   - A restart of the session (without unplugging) by applying Control Pilot state E transition (often triggered by error handling).\n\n3. **X1 or X2 (5\u202f%)**  \n   - Control Pilot (CP) state at 5\u202f% duty cycle (or nominally \u201cX1\u201d if not yet stabilized).  \n   - NOTE\u202f1: As indicated, CP state \u201cX1\u201d is allowed instead of \u201cX2 (nom.)\u201d per IEC\u20113 Table\u202f5.\n\n4. **X2 (5\u202f% or nom.) \"Matched state\" and authorization OK**  \n   - A state signifying that the EV and EVSE have achieved a matched condition at CP state X2 (which can be 5\u202f% or nominal duty cycle); authorization is validated.\n\n5. **EIM done & matching process not started**  \n   - A condition where EIM (External Identification Means) is completed, but the V2G \u201cmatching process\u201d (high-level communication negotiation) has not yet begun.\n\n6. **E/F (0\u202f%)**  \n   - A Control Pilot state indicating 0\u202f% duty cycle.

Step-by-Step Flow Description\n\nBelow is the sequence of steps shown in the diagram, from left to right and top to bottom.  \n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   - The EV is connected to the EVSE.  \n   - At this moment, the EVSE typically sets the Control Pilot to either **X1** or **X2 (5\u202f%)**.\n\n2. **Initial CP State: X1 or X2 (5\u202f%)**  \n   - According to the standard, the EVSE might start with a 5\u202f% duty cycle to indicate a low-current or minimal power state.  \n   - **In parallel**, a \u201cRe-init\u201d action could also lead the CP state back to **X1 or X2 (5\u202f%)** (this can happen if an error arises and the EVSE needs to reset the session without physically unplugging).\n\n3. **Two Parallel Paths Emerge**  \n\n   ### Path A \u2013 \u201cMatched State\u201d with Authorization (Top Branch)\n\n   3A. **X2 (5\u202f% or nom.) \"Matched state\" and authorization OK**  \n       - If the EV and EVSE move quickly into a matched state at X2 (either 5\u202f% or nominal), and the EV\u2019s authorization is confirmed (for example, via **PnC** credentials automatically), then it proceeds as follows:\n\n   4A. **PnC**  \n       - This indicates \u201cPlug and Charge.\u201d The EVSE instructs high-level communication for finalizing charging parameters.\n\n   5A. **HLC\u2011C**  \n       - The EVSE and EV exchange ISO\u00a015118 (V2G) messages. This is mandatory if using PnC in AC-charging with HLC.\n\n   6A. **V2G Setup finished**  \n       - Once the high-level communication successfully completes, the system is ready and can begin actual power transfer under the PnC agreement.  \n\n   *(End of Path A)*\n\n   ### Path B \u2013 EIM Done & Matching Not Started (Middle Branch)\n\n   3B. **EIM done & matching process not started**  \n       - The EIM process (e.g., scanning an RFID card) is finished, but the V2G \u201cmatching\u201d session has not begun.  \n       - The EVSE transitions to an error or reset state on the Control Pilot:\n\n   4B. **E/F (0\u202f%)**  \n       - The duty cycle is driven to 0\u202f%. This is an error/reset state or a neutral state forcing the EV to stop momentarily.\n\n   5B. **T_step_EF**  \n       - The EVSE remains in CP state E or F for a required duration (T_step_EF). This wait is mandatory before re-enabling a normal charging state.\n\n   6B. **X2 (nom.)**  \n       - After T_step_EF, the EVSE sets the duty cycle to the nominal level (X2). This indicates an intent to supply standard AC current.  \n\n   From **X2 (nom.)**, we see three sub-branches:\n\n   - **b) EIM w. BC**  \n     7b. The \u201cb)\u201d label indicates \u201cEIM with Basic Charging.\u201d Once the system is at X2(nom.), the EV can start charging based solely on **IEC\u00a061851\u20111**.  \n     8b. **BC** is used (the PWM duty cycle signals the requested current).  \n     9b. **V2G Setup finished** (here, it effectively means no high-level comm is used for controlling power or has ended).  \n     10b. Charging proceeds with BC.\n\n   - **c) EIM w/o BC**  \n     7c. The \u201cc)\u201d label indicates \u201cEIM without Basic Charging,\u201d meaning the EV and EVSE do use **HLC\u2011C** (ISO\u00a015118 high-level communication) to regulate charging.  \n     8c. **HLC\u2011C** is started. The standard\u2019s V2G messages help orchestrate the charging session.  \n     9c. **V2G Setup finished.**  \n     10c. Charging now occurs under high-level communications, with EIM credentials having authorized it.\n\n   - **d) [IEC\u20111] Charging**  \n     7d. The \u201cd)\u201d label references **IEC\u00a061851\u20111**-only charging. **NOTE\u202f2** states that this branch is used by EVs that do **not** support HLC\u2011C.  \n     8d. The EVSE continues in Basic Charging mode with the nominal duty cycle on the Control Pilot.  \n     9d. The EV charges following **IEC\u00a061851\u20111** specifications.  \n\n   *(End of Paths B, b), c), and d) )*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relationship and Connection of Entities\n\n- **Trigger conditions (\u201cPlug-in\u201d / \u201cRe-init\u201d)**: These conditions cause the CP state to go to **X1 or X2 (5\u202f%)**. Re-init is typically an internal reset without physical disconnection.  \n- **Control Pilot States (X1, X2, E, F)**: These represent distinct duty-cycle signals sent by the EVSE to the EV.  \n- **EIM or PnC**:  \n  - **PnC** automatically authorizes the EV if it supports the ISO\u00a015118 plug-and-charge certificate exchange.  \n  - **EIM** involves an external user action (e.g., RFID card).  \n- **HLC\u2011C** vs. **BC**:  \n  - **HLC\u2011C** stands for \u201cHigh\u2011Level Communication Controlled\u201d charging, governed by ISO\u00a015118 messages.  \n  - **BC** stands for \u201cBasic Charging,\u201d governed by IEC\u00a061851\u20111 duty cycle alone.  \n- **Matching Process**: The step where the EV and EVSE exchange messages to confirm that advanced communication is possible and desired (via HLC\u2011C). In the figure, if that process is \u201cnot started\u201d before EIM is done, the EVSE is shown forcing a short E/F(0\u202f%) state before rejoining the nominal X2.  \n- **T_step_EF**: A defined time to remain at 0\u202f% duty cycle for transitional or error recovery steps.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Extras / Notes\n\n- **NOTE\u202f1**: The chart allows CP State X1 as an alternative to X2(nom.) in early or transitional steps, aligning with IEC standards.  \n- **NOTE\u202f2**: The \u201cd)\u201d branch specifically caters to EVs that cannot handle ISO\u00a015118 high-level communication. They will remain in IEC\u00a061851\u20111 basic mode.  \n- **Mandatory vs. Possible Procedures**:  \n  - Solid arrows are steps that must occur according to the standard if the conditions apply.  \n  - Dashed or dotted arrows are possible transitions depending on EV/EVSE capabilities.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nIn essence, **Figure\u202f3** shows how an **AC EVSE** can handle different authorization scenarios (**PnC** or **EIM**) and how the system either proceeds into **high-level communication** (HLC\u2011C) or stays with **basic IEC 61851\u20111** charging. The *matching process* for ISO\u00a015118 can begin once the EV is at a suitable control pilot state (X2). If the EV does **not** support HLC\u2011C, it will remain at nominal duty cycle X2 and proceed with basic AC charging (branch **d**). For an EV that does support HLC\u2011C, it can either do **PnC** (branch **a**) or **EIM** (branches **b/c**) with high-level communication or fallback to BC if HLC fails.\n\nAll paths ensure that the EVSE and EV coordinate on CP states (X1, X2, E/F with 0\u202f%) to manage transitions (like resets or error states) before the final charging mode is achieved.",
    "iso3-image_12.png": "# Detailed Description of Figure A.9 \u2014 Example of Sequence Chart of Matching Process Error Handling\n\nBelow is a step-by-step explanation, in **Markdown** format, of the sequence chart labeled **Figure A.9**. This figure illustrates the **SLAC (Signal-Level Attenuation Characterization) matching process** between an Electric Vehicle (EV) and an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), with emphasis on how errors and timing constraints are handled. The diagram shows four main entities:\n\n1. **EV Host**  \n2. **EV PLC node** (the EV\u2019s low-layer communication module)  \n3. **EVSE PLC node** (the EVSE\u2019s low-layer communication module)  \n4. **EVSE Host**\n\nVarious **timers** and **messages** govern the retry logic, confirmations, and triggering conditions. The goal is to establish a matched communication link (sometimes referred to as SLAC matching). This specific figure highlights an error-handling example where the EV repeatedly sends parameter requests until the EVSE\u2019s low-layer module is fully ready.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities and Their Roles\n\n1. **EV Host**  \n   - Coordinates overall EV-side communication and initiates the SLAC matching sequence upon detecting plug-in or other triggers.  \n   - Waits for \u201cMatching Process Start Trigger\u201d to begin SLAC parameter exchange.\n\n2. **EV PLC Node**  \n   - The EV\u2019s low-layer communication module that actually sends and receives SLAC messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ).  \n   - Interacts with the EVSE\u2019s PLC node to configure parameters, confirm matching status, and finalize the SLAC link.\n\n3. **EVSE PLC Node**  \n   - The EVSE\u2019s low-layer communication module. It responds to requests from the EV PLC node and eventually sends a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF message when ready.  \n   - May be initially \u201casleep\u201d or in a booting state, causing the EV to resend parameter requests if no confirmation is received.\n\n4. **EVSE Host**  \n   - Oversees the EVSE side, can send key-setting commands to the EVSE PLC node (CM_SET_KEY.REQ) and receives confirmations (CM_SET_KEY.CNF).  \n   - Also waits internally for the \u201cMatching Process Start Trigger\u201d before instructing the low-layer module to proceed with matching.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Messages in the Chart\n\n- **CM_SET_KEY.REQ** / **CM_SET_KEY.CNF**  \n  Used by the EVSE Host to set cryptographic or network keys in the EVSE PLC module. A request/confirmation exchange (REQ/CNF) ensures keys are established before proceeding.\n\n- **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ**  \n  A crucial request message sent by the EV PLC node. It initiates or retries the SLAC parameter negotiation. Several of these may be sent if the EVSE PLC node is not yet ready to respond.\n\n- **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  \n  The confirmation message that the EVSE PLC node sends in response to a valid CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ. Once this is received by the EV PLC node, the matching process can progress to the next stage (or conclude if final parameters are agreed).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Timers and Their Significance\n\nThe figure shows multiple timers or time parameters in the margin. Each timer serves a distinct purpose in error handling and retry logic during matching:\n\n- **TP_EV_SLAC_init**:  \n  A time parameter on the EV side. Indicates when the EV is ready to start sending SLAC messages after plug-in or initialization.\n\n- **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**:  \n  A similar timeout event on the EVSE side, signifying the EVSE\u2019s readiness for the matching process (or that it is still booting).\n\n- **TT_match_response** and **TP_match_response**:  \n  Both appear repeatedly in the message sequence. They govern how long each side waits for a response to SLAC messages (e.g., how long the EV will await a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF before resending a CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ).  \n  - \u201cTT_match_response\u201d often indicates a test timeout or internal handling.  \n  - \u201cTP_match_response\u201d can denote a performance or protocol timer requiring the message to be answered within a specific duration.\n\n- **TT_matching_rate**:  \n  A wait time before restarting the SLAC matching process after a failure or no-response scenario. Used to avoid flooding the network with frequent retry attempts.\n\n- **TT_matching_repetition**:  \n  The maximum duration or repetition window during which multiple matching attempts can be retried before concluding that matching has failed entirely.\n\n- **TT_match_sequence** / **TP_match_sequence**:  \n  These timers define or bound the overall sequence of matching attempts. \u201cTT_match_sequence\u201d may mark the final stage of the matching process or the cutoff for the entire exchange sequence.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Step-by-Step Flow of the Sequence Chart\n\n### A. Initial Key-Setting on the EVSE Side\n\n1. **EVSE Host \u2192 EVSE PLC node: CM_SET_KEY.REQ**  \n   - The EVSE Host sends a request to configure or set security/network keys on the EVSE PLC node.\n\n2. **EVSE PLC node \u2192 EVSE Host: CM_SET_KEY.CNF**  \n   - The EVSE PLC node confirms successful key setting back to the EVSE Host.  \n   - After this step, the EVSE side is (or soon will be) ready to exchange SLAC parameters, once the matching trigger event starts.\n\n### B. Waiting for Matching Process Start\n\n3. **EV Host**: \u201cWait for Matching Process Start Trigger\u201d  \n   - On the EV side, the system is idle until the matching process is triggered (e.g., plug-in detected or higher-layer instruction).\n\n4. **EVSE Host**: \u201cWait for Matching Process Start Trigger\u201d  \n   - Similarly, the EVSE Host is also waiting for the condition to begin the SLAC matching process.\n\n5. **TP_EV_SLAC_init** and **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**  \n   - These timers are activated (or at least monitored) to ensure both sides begin matching in a timely manner.  \n   - \u201cTP_EV_SLAC_init\u201d is often started on the EV side, while \u201cTT_EVSE_SLAC_init\u201d is tracked on the EVSE side.\n\n### C. Repeated SLAC Parameter Requests and Error Handling\n\n6. **EV PLC node \u2192 EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Attempt 1)  \n   - As soon as the EV is ready, it sends the first parameter request to the EVSE.  \n   - If the EVSE PLC node is not fully operational yet, no immediate response is given.\n\n7. **Timer Trigger: TT_match_response** or **TP_match_response**  \n   - The EV waits for a response from the EVSE PLC node within a defined time.  \n   - If no **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** is received, the EV concludes the EVSE is not ready and may resend the request.\n\n8. **EV PLC node \u2192 EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Attempt 2, 3, \u2026)  \n   - The EV PLC node continues sending CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ at intervals governed by **TT_match_response** (or **TP_match_response**).  \n   - Each attempt is followed by another wait period.  \n   - If the EVSE PLC node remains unresponsive, the timer **TT_matching_rate** might also come into play to delay the next retry.\n\n9. **TT_matching_repetition**  \n   - This overarching timer is running in the background. It ensures the total number of attempts remains within a certain window.  \n   - If the EV times out on repeated attempts (and **TT_matching_repetition** expires), the process transitions to a \u201cfailed\u201d state.\n\n10. **EV PLC node \u2192 EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Final Attempt)  \n    - Eventually, the EVSE PLC node is ready (i.e., has finished booting or is fully awake).\n\n11. **EVSE PLC node \u2192 EV PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  \n    - At long last, the EVSE responds with the confirmation message.  \n    - Reception of **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** indicates that the EVSE PLC node has accepted the request parameters and has effectively \u201ccaught up\u201d to the EV\u2019s repeated attempts.\n\n### D. Conclusion of Matching Sequence\n\n12. **TP_match_sequence** and **TT_match_sequence**  \n    - As soon as the correct confirmation is received, the final matching sequence timers are observed.  \n    - Typically, this implies the SLAC parameter exchange has succeeded, or at least the matching process can progress to the next step in the standard (e.g., amplitude map exchange or final link readiness).\n\n13. **Matched State**  \n    - Once a valid exchange has completed, the link enters the \u201cMatched\u201d state (per the standard\u2019s definitions).  \n    - At this point, no further **CM_SLAC_PARM** messages should be sent (per [V2G3-A09-118]) unless the process fails or restarts.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Relationships and Connections\n\n1. **Key Setting First, Then SLAC Matching**  \n   - The EVSE Host sets up keys on the EVSE PLC node before the matching process triggers.  \n   - This ensures that secure or correct network parameters are in place once the EV and EVSE attempt to exchange SLAC parameters.\n\n2. **Timers Govern Retrying and Error Handling**  \n   - Each **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** attempt has a corresponding timer (TT_match_response / TP_match_response). If no reply is received within that window, the EV resends.  \n   - Global repetition timers **TT_matching_repetition** and **TT_matching_rate** regulate how often and how many times the EV can resend these requests before declaring failure.\n\n3. **Confirmation Ends Parameter Repetition**  \n   - Once **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** arrives, the repeated attempts stop.  \n   - The EV and EVSE effectively coordinate to finalize the link parameters.\n\n4. **High-Level Wait States**  \n   - Both the EV Host and EVSE Host remain in a \u201cWait for Matching Process Start Trigger\u201d state until preconditions (like plug-in or system readiness) are met.  \n   - Only after triggers and initial timers do the low-layer modules actually exchange messages.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary\n\nFigure A.9 demonstrates a **typical SLAC matching sequence** with a strong focus on **error recovery and timing**. The EV tries multiple times to initiate the parameter exchange, while the EVSE might be booting or unready to respond. Each repeated **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** is gated by **TT_match_response**. If the EVSE still does not confirm, the EV eventually retries but must obey the higher-level timers (**TT_matching_rate**, **TT_matching_repetition**). Ultimately, the EVSE PLC node becomes active, responds with **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**, and the process can conclude successfully within **TT_match_sequence**.  \n\nSuch a design ensures robust handling of real-world delays (e.g., EVSE boot times) and aligns with ISO 15118-3 requirements that define how an \u201cUnmatched\u201d state eventually transitions to \u201cMatched,\u201d or else leads to a matching failure if all retries are exhausted.\n\n---\n\n> **Note:** These timers, messages, and states are specified in ISO 15118-3 Annex A for HomePlug Green PHY communication over the vehicle\u2019s control pilot line. The standard also provides additional constraints (e.g., amplitude map exchange in A.9.6) and states that no further SLAC messages shall be processed once a \u201cMatched\u201d state is achieved ([V2G3-A09-118]).",
    "iso3-image_13.png": "# Detailed Description of the Flow Chart (Figure 3)  \n\nBelow is a step-by-step explanation of the flow chart, including each key entity, the transitions between states, and how they relate to one another. This chart describes an AC EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) supporting different modes of charging, including High-Level Communication Charging (HLC-C) and Basic Charging (BC), under both Plug & Charge (PnC) and External Identification Means (EIM). \n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Overview\n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   The moment the EV is physically connected to the EVSE.\n\n2. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   Indicates that upon plug-in, the Control Pilot (CP) can be in either state X1 or state X2 with a 5% duty cycle.  \n   \u2022 NOTE 1: According to IEC standards ([IEC\u20103], Table 5), CP state X1 may be used for a brief period until the CP oscillator is switched on. If not using X1, then 5% duty cycle in X2 is used instead.\n\n3. **X2 (5%)**  \n   Shows the CP remains at 5% duty cycle while waiting for authorization or the start of the matching process.\n\n4. **\u201cMatched state\u201d and authorization OK**  \n   Once the EV and EVSE have established that the authorization (PnC or EIM) is successful, and the matching process (for high-level communication) is complete, the charging can proceed under HLC-C.\n\n5. **EIM done & matching process not started**  \n   An indication that External Identification Means is completed, but the matching process (to move to HLC-C) has not started. This situation might lead to remaining in a 5% duty cycle or transitioning to other states.\n\n6. **Re-init**  \n   A session restart without physically unplugging the EV (often triggered by an error or a control pilot transition to state E).\n\n7. **E/F (0%)**  \n   The control pilot is in an error or fault state (0% duty cycle). This typically happens if a fault or error has been detected, or if the system invokes a \u201cre-init\u201d procedure.\n\n8. **T_step_EF**  \n   The specific time duration the system remains in the E/F (0%) state (error handling) before transitioning back to a normal control pilot state.  \n   \u2022 T_step_EF is defined by the standard to allow proper reset/clearing of faults.\n\n9. **X2 (nom.)**  \n   The nominal duty cycle in control pilot state X2 (indicating readiness for normal or basic charging). When HLC-C is not active or is completed, the CP uses the nominal duty cycle instead of 5%.\n\n10. **HLC-C (charging controlled by high-level communication)**  \n    Indicates that charging (or \u201cV2G Setup\u201d) is controlled via ISO 15118 high-level messages. PnC or EIM with HLC-C will use this path.\n\n11. **BC (charging controlled by IEC 61851-1)**  \n    Basic charging mode (without high-level communication). This is allowed before or after the high-level communication session, or as a fallback if the EV does not support HLC-C.\n\n12. **V2G Setup finished**  \n    Signals that the high-level communication (ISO 15118) setup phase is completed.\n\n13. **a) PnC**  \n    Branch \u201ca\u201d indicates the Plug & Charge path where authorization and matching take place over the high-level communication interface.\n\n14. **b) EIM w. BC**  \n    Branch \u201cb\u201d is for External Identification Means with Basic Charging. The EVSE and EV proceed in a basic IEC 61851-1 manner once EIM is successful.\n\n15. **c) EIM w/o BC**  \n    Branch \u201cc\u201d is for an EVSE that supports EIM and HLC-C but does not do full BC fallback. The result is high-level communication (HLC-C) for charging.\n\n16. **d) [IEC-1] Charging**  \n    Branch \u201cd\u201d shows the fallback or default IEC 61851-1 charging for EVs that do not support HLC-C.  \n    \u2022 NOTE 2: This branch is specifically for EVs not supporting HLC-C.\n\n17. **Trigger condition**  \n    Marked by an open arrow outline in the key. It indicates a condition (like \u201cMatched state,\u201d \u201cauthorization OK,\u201d or \u201cRe-init\u201d) that triggers a transition.\n\n18. **Possible procedure (dotted arrow)** versus **Mandatory procedure (solid arrow)**  \n    Per the chart key, certain steps are allowed/possible, whereas others are mandatory in this coordination sequence.\n\n19. **Refer to IEC 61851-1 Ed 3, A5**  \n    A reference pointing to further details in the IEC 61851-1 standard regarding nominal CP states and transitions.\n\n20. **NOTE 1**  \n    \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC-3] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d This clarifies that the EVSE may briefly apply X1 as an alternative to X2(nom.) in certain conditions.\n\n21. **NOTE 2**  \n    \u201cBranch d) is for EVs not supporting HLC-C.\u201d This clarifies that path \u201cd\u201d in the diagram applies only to vehicles that cannot handle high-level communication.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)\n\nBelow is the logical progression from plug-in to charging, including all key points:\n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   - The EV is physically connected to the EVSE (control pilot circuit becomes active).\n\n2. **Initial CP State (X1 or X2 at 5% duty cycle)**  \n   - Right after plugging in, the EVSE may apply either:  \n     \u2022 X1 (5%) briefly, or  \n     \u2022 X2 (5%) immediately.  \n   - This 5% duty cycle indicates a low-current pilot signal, often used when the matching process (for HLC-C) is not started yet or when PnC/EIM authorization has not completed.\n\n3. **Transition to X2 (5%)**  \n   - If X1 was used initially, the EVSE then transitions to X2 at 5% duty cycle.  \n   - At this point, the \u201cV2G Setup\u201d may finish if the EV and EVSE quickly reach the \u201cmatched state\u201d and authorization is OK (PnC or EIM).\n\n4. **Check Authorization / Matching**  \n   - If the EVSE detects that the vehicle is in the \u201cmatched state\u201d with authorization OK (e.g., PnC done successfully or EIM done successfully with HLC-C), the diagram shows branch **a)** for PnC.  \n   - Otherwise, if the EIM is done but the matching process has not started, the EVSE may hold the 5% duty cycle or move to handle basic charging.\n\n5. **Re-init Condition (Optional Error Handling)**  \n   - If an error arises before successful authorization, the EVSE (or EV) may force a \u201cRe-init.\u201d  \n   - \u201cRe-init\u201d triggers a transition to CP state **E/F (0%)**.\n\n6. **E/F (0%) State**  \n   - The EVSE remains in E or F at 0% duty cycle for a duration **T_step_EF**, allowing the system to reset or clear fault conditions.\n\n7. **Transition to X2 (nom.)**  \n   - After T_step_EF, the EVSE switches the control pilot to **X2 (nom.)**, the normal duty cycle for potential basic charging or high-level communication readiness.\n   - At this point, there are several possible (and mandatory) branches:\n\n   ### a) PnC  \n   - If \u201cMatched state\u201d and PnC authorization are confirmed, high-level communication (HLC-C) controls the charging session (marked as \u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d).\n\n   ### b) EIM w. BC (External Identification Means with Basic Charging)  \n   - If EIM is used and the EVSE is configured to allow BC fallback, the EV charges under IEC 61851-1 control.  \n   - The diagram labels this as \u201cb) EIM w. BC\u201d with a mandatory arrow to \u201cBC\u201d or to \u201cHLC-C,\u201d depending on the setup.\n\n   ### c) EIM w/o BC (External Identification Means without Basic Charging fallback)  \n   - The EVSE supports EIM, but does not provide a Basic Charging fallback. Instead, once authorized, the system proceeds to high-level communication (HLC-C).  \n   - Labeled \u201cc) EIM w/o BC.\u201d\n\n   ### d) [IEC-1] Charging (No HLC-C Support)  \n   - This is the simple IEC 61851-1 path for EVs **not** supporting high-level communication.  \n   - **NOTE 2** reminds us that branch \u201cd)\u201d is explicitly for EVs incapable of HLC-C.\n\n8. **V2G Setup Finished**  \n   - For cases (a) PnC and (c) EIM w/o BC, the EVSE can complete the \u201cV2G Setup\u201d (i.e., high-level communication is established), and the EV can start charging with HLC-C controlling the current.  \n   - For (b) EIM w. BC or (d) IEC 61851-1, the EV charges under basic control pilot rules (nominal duty cycle).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection of Entities\n\n1. **Control Pilot States (X1, X2, E/F)**  \n   - These states indicate the duty cycle signals from the EVSE to the EV.  \n   - X1 or X2 at 5% represents \u201climited pilot signal\u201d while waiting for matching or authorization.  \n   - X2 (nom.) represents \u201cnormal pilot signal,\u201d allowing higher charging current or standard communication.  \n   - E/F (0%) is the error or fault state, where no charging current is offered.\n\n2. **High-Level Communication (HLC-C) vs. Basic Charging (BC)**  \n   - HLC-C requires a matching process and an active ISO 15118 negotiation. Once authorized (PnC or EIM w/o BC), the EVSE and EV exchange communication messages to control charging.  \n   - BC is the fallback or simpler mode, controlled by IEC 61851-1 duty cycles. It is used if the EV does not support high-level communication or if the system transitions to a basic mode.\n\n3. **Authorization Paths**  \n   - **PnC (a)**: Fully automatic method with contract certificates (Plug & Charge).  \n   - **EIM (b, c)**: The user must apply some external identification, possibly an RFID card or other method.  \n   - If an EV does not support HLC-C, branch **d** is used.\n\n4. **Re-init / Error Handling**  \n   - \u201cRe-init\u201d indicates that the system restarts the session logic (without a physical unplug) by transitioning to E/F (0%) for a set time **T_step_EF**.\n\n5. **Notes and References**  \n   - **NOTE 1**: CP state X1 is equivalent in usage to X2 (nom.) for a limited timeframe, based on IEC 61851-1 guidelines.  \n   - **NOTE 2**: Branch (d) is specifically for vehicles not supporting HLC-C.  \n   - **Refer to IEC 61851\u20101 Ed 3, A5**: For deeper details on the CP states and transitions, especially X1 vs. X2 usage.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- The flow chart details how an EVSE handles an EV connection from plug-in through error conditions (Re-init/E/F) to different charging modes (PnC, EIM with or without BC, or pure IEC 61851-1).  \n- The fundamental distinction is between using high-level communication (HLC-C) under ISO 15118 or defaulting to basic IEC 61851-1 control (BC).  \n- The 5% duty cycle (X2 or X1) is used directly after plug-in for authorization and matching steps.  \n- Once \u201cV2G Setup\u201d is finished (PnC or EIM w/o BC), the EV can charge under high-level communication.  \n- If the EV does not support HLC-C, or if an error triggers re-init, the EVSE can revert to basic charging (nominal X2 duty cycle).\n\nBy following this step-by-step diagram, engineers can quickly discern the control pilot behavior at each phase of the charging process, helping them implement or troubleshoot ISO 15118-3\u2013compliant AC charging scenarios.",
    "iso3-image_14.png": "## 1. **Entities Overview**\n\nBelow is a list of the key entities and notations shown in the figure, along with brief definitions or notes:\n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   Indicates that the EV (Electric Vehicle) is physically connected to the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment).\n\n2. **Re-init**  \n   A trigger condition that implies re-initialization of the charging or communication process.\n\n3. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   \u2022 These represent control pilot states after the EV is plugged in.  \n   \u2022 \u201cX2 (5%)\u201d often indicates a 5% duty cycle on the control pilot, meaning the EVSE is signaling a low current or limited mode.  \n   \u2022 \u201cX1\u201d is a control pilot state defined in certain IEC standards.  \n   \u2022 Per the note, CP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nominal) following [IEC-3] (Table 5).  \n   \u2022 \u201cX1 is required by TS\u00a062763\u201d is an additional note found in the diagram.\n\n4. **X2 (5% or nom.)**  \n   Once communication or certain conditions are met, the control pilot can be set to either 5% duty cycle or its nominal (full) duty cycle. \u201cNominal\u201d typically means a normal charging current limit.\n\n5. **EIM done & matching process started**  \n   \u201cEIM\u201d denotes External Identification Means. This label indicates that the EVSE has completed authentication/identification by external means, and a matching process for PnC (Plug and Charge) or other protocols has begun.\n\n6. **\u201cMatched state\u201d and authorization OK**  \n   A state where the EVSE and EV have successfully exchanged necessary authorization data (e.g., for PnC or EIM) and are ready to proceed with charging setup.\n\n7. **a)\u00a0PnC**  \n   Indicates the pathway for charging using Plug-and-Charge under high-level communication (HLC). Shown as a dedicated branch labeled \u201ca)\u00a0PnC.\u201d\n\n8. **b)\u00a0EIM w/ BC**  \n   Indicates the path for charging with External Identification Means and \u201cBC\u201d (Basic Charging). The label \u201cBC charging controlled by IEC\u00a061851\u20111\u201d means this branch follows standard IEC\u00a061851\u20111 basic signaling without advanced high-level communication for energy/power negotiation.\n\n9. **c)\u00a0EIM w/o BC**  \n   Another EIM branch without Basic Charging fallback (or \u201cw/o BC\u201d). In this diagram, the EV may still use HLC-C for control or complete the process differently.\n\n10. **HLC-C**  \n    Stands for \u201cHigh-Level Communication \u2013 Control,\u201d referring to an EV and EVSE communication interface governed by upper-layer protocols (per ISO\u00a015118). The label \u201ccharging controlled by high-level communication\u201d clarifies that the EV and EVSE negotiate charging parameters using a higher-level standardized protocol.\n\n11. **BC**  \n    \u201cBasic Charging,\u201d which follows IEC\u00a061851\u20111, uses only the PWM duty cycle on the control pilot to communicate available current, without additional data link layers.\n\n12. **V2G Setup finished**  \n    V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) services are set up. This note indicates that the initialization (communication, authorization, and matching) is complete.\n\n13. **Possible procedure** (dashed arrow)  \n    Indicates that this path may occur under certain conditions but is not mandatory.\n\n14. **Mandatory procedure** (solid arrow)  \n    Indicates that this path must occur in the standard defined sequence.\n\n15. **Trigger condition** (arrow with open box)  \n    Highlights an external event or action that triggers a state transition, such as \u201cRe-init.\u201d\n\n16. **Note**  \n    \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC\u20113].\u201d This clarifies that certain EVSEs may use X1 in place of nominal X2 under IEC guidelines.\n\n\n## 2. **Flow of the Diagram**\n\nBelow is a step-by-step walk-through of the entire flow based on the figure:\n\n1. **Start: Plug-in**  \n   - The process begins with the EV being physically connected to the EVSE.  \n   - Immediately after plug-in, the control pilot can be in **X1** or **X2 (5%)**.  \n   - In some designs, the EVSE may initially apply **X1**, and in others, a 5% duty cycle (X2) is established.\n\n2. **Re-init (Optional Trigger)**  \n   - There is a possibility that a \u201cRe-init\u201d trigger occurs. If so, the system might revert to the initial condition of X1 or X2 (5%), effectively restarting the coordination process.\n\n3. **EIM Done & Matching Process Started**  \n   - When External Identification Means is completed (e.g., RFID authentication or another method) and the matching process (for user authorization or contract setup) begins, the EVSE may transition the control pilot state to either **X1** or **X2 (5% or nominal)**.\n\n4. **Proceed to X2 (5% or nominal)**  \n   - After EIM is done, the control pilot often shifts or remains at a recognized state, typically **X2** with either a restricted 5% duty cycle or the nominal duty cycle.  \n   - There is a note (in the diagram) specifying that the EVSE can apply X1 if needed (per TS\u00a062763), but for most cases, X2 is used.\n\n5. **\u201cMatched State\u201d & Authorization OK**  \n   - Once the EVSE and EV have validated each other (e.g., cryptographic handshake, contract validation, or user identification is approved), they achieve a \u201cmatched state.\u201d  \n   - This means that the EV is fully authorized to proceed with charging, and the system can complete the V2G communication steps.\n\n6. **Branching into Three Main Paths**  \n   - After reaching the matched/authorized state, the setup is effectively complete (noted by \u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d), and the diagram shows three branches:\n\n   **a) PnC**  \n   - Plug-and-Charge path that uses HLC-C (high-level communication). Charging is entirely controlled by ISO\u00a015118 protocols over a high-level data link.  \n\n   **b) EIM w/ BC**  \n   - External Identification Means with Basic Charging. The EVSE and EV continue charging under IEC\u00a061851\u20111 basic pilot signaling (\u201cBC\u201d), but the overall session is still recognized as EIM-based. High-level communication (HLC-C) might be used for some coordination but the actual current control is handled by BC signals.  \n\n   **c) EIM w/o BC**  \n   - External Identification Means (with no basic charging fallback). The EV and EVSE rely on HLC-C for control once authorized. The current levels and charging details are governed purely by high-level communications.\n\n7. **V2G Setup Finished**  \n   - In each branch, once the matching and authorization steps are validated, the communication channel is established or not needed (depending on BC vs. HLC-C). The vehicle and EVSE are now in a position to deliver power under the correct protocol and policies. The note \u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d emphasizes the system is ready for energy transfer, time-based adjustments, or other V2G-related functions.\n\n8. **Note about X1 vs. X2**  \n   - If the EVSE chooses to apply CP state X1 (instead of X2 nominal) at certain times, this is allowed by IEC references, but typically X2 nominal is expected for normal charging readiness.  \n   - Additional references mention that X1 might be used temporarily or in certain compliance contexts (TS\u00a062763).\n\nThroughout the flow, **solid arrows** denote **mandatory steps** specified by the standard, and **dashed arrows** denote **possible (optional or conditional) procedures** that may or may not occur, based on the EVSE\u2019s capabilities or the local configuration.\n\n\n## 3. **Relationship and Connection of Entities**\n\n- **EVSE and EV**: The diagram revolves around their interaction\u2014from the moment of plugging in to the completion of the V2G setup.  \n- **Control Pilot States (X1 or X2)**: These states define the electrical conditions on the control pilot line per IEC\u00a061851\u20101 or TS\u00a062763. Either X1 or X2 (5% or nominal) signals the readiness and current capacity available to the EV.  \n- **HLC-C (High-Level Communication)**: Serves as a communication channel (ISO\u00a015118) enabling advanced features like Plug-and-Charge (PnC) and dynamic negotiation of charging parameters.  \n- **BC (Basic Charging)**: Uses the simpler IEC\u00a061851\u20131 PWM scheme. When the EVSE or EV is not using the advanced HLC, they fall back to BC for setting current limits (branch b) and (by extension) c).  \n- **EIM**: Provides user identification external to the vehicle (e.g., via RFID or smartphone). Once \u201cEIM done,\u201d authorization and matching processes can either continue or finalize for charging.\n\nIn summary, the flow chart details how an AC EVSE can coordinate multiple charging modes (PnC, EIM with BC, or EIM without BC):\n\n\u2022 It starts when the EV is plugged in (applying X1 or X2 at 5% duty cycle).  \n\u2022 Moves through user/contract authentication (EIM done, matching process).  \n\u2022 Transitions to a valid charging or matched state (X2 nominal or remain at 5% if needed).  \n\u2022 Finally splits into whichever method is supported or authorized\u2014PnC (high-level comm) or EIM-based charging (either with or without BC).\n\nAll of these steps ensure the EV and EVSE establish the correct communication and power transfer settings before actual charging begins.",
    "iso3-image_15.png": "# Detailed Description of the Flow Chart\n\nBelow is a step-by-step description of the flow chart shown in the figure. The diagram illustrates an AC EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) supporting High-Level Communication Control (HLC\u2011C) with both \u201cPlug & Charge\u201d (PnC) and EIM (External Identification Means). It also shows where Basic Charging (BC) fits in the process. The important note here is that some EVSEs support both PnC and EIM, while others may only support one path. Additionally, Control Pilot (CP) states X1 or X2 govern the duty cycle used on the control pilot signal.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Overview\n\n1. **Plug-in**  \n   The event where the EV is physically connected to the EVSE.\n\n2. **Re-init**  \n   A trigger condition indicating that the EVSE and/or EV re-initializes the communication or charging process.\n\n3. **CP State X1 (100%)**  \n   A control pilot state that can be active immediately after plugging in (100% duty cycle).  \n   \u2013 Note: \u201cX1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC-3] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d\n\n4. **CP State X2 (nom.)**  \n   A nominal control pilot state that is typically used once the EVSE begins its normal duty cycle configuration.\n\n5. **CP State X2 (5% or nom.)**  \n   A possibly reduced duty cycle (at 5%) or nominal duty cycle, used to signal and confirm matching/authorization states between the EV and EVSE.\n\n6. **\u201cMatched state\u201d and authorization OK**  \n   Indicates that the EV and EVSE have successfully \u201cmatched\u201d each other\u2019s communication requirements and that authorization to charge is confirmed.\n\n7. **EIM done & matching process started**  \n   After the External Identification Means is completed, the matching process (which checks that the EV and EVSE can communicate properly) begins.\n\n8. **V2G Setup finished**  \n   Denotes that the high-level Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communication setup is established (in other words, the communication handshake is complete).\n\n9. **HLC\u2011C**  \n   \u201cHigh-Level Communication Control\u201d: indicates charging that is controlled via ISO 15118 high-level messages.\n\n10. **BC**  \n   \u201cBasic Charging\u201d (controlled by IEC 61851\u20111): a simpler control mechanism using the basic control pilot signals without advanced ISO 15118 communication features.\n\n11. **a) PnC**  \n   A branch of the process for \u201cPlug & Charge,\u201d whereby authentication and authorization can be done automatically via certificates exchanged over high-level communication.\n\n12. **b) EIM w/ BC**  \n   A branch indicating blended EIM with Basic Charging. Communication is still possible at a high level, but actual current or power levels may be regulated in a simpler manner (BC).\n\n13. **c) EIM w/o BC**  \n   A branch in which EIM is used, and the charging proceeds without Basic Charging fallback (or simply uses the high-level communication directly).\n\n14. **possible procedure** (dashed arrow)  \n   Indicates a pathway or step that is allowed but not strictly mandatory in every implementation.\n\n15. **mandatory procedure** (solid arrow)  \n   Indicates a step that is required per the standard or the scenario.\n\n16. **trigger condition** (block arrow)  \n   A condition or event that initiates a transition (e.g., \u201cRe-init,\u201d \u201cEIM done,\u201d etc.).\n\n17. **NOTE**  \n   \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC\u20113] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2. Flow of the Diagram\n\nThe chart can be broken down into the following sequence:\n\n1. **Plug-in \u2192 X1 (100%)**  \n   - The EV is plugged in.  \n   - Initially, the control pilot may be in state X1 (100% duty cycle).  \n   - This step might be very brief or can remain active until the EVSE activates its control pilot oscillator.  \n   - Alternatively, some implementations go directly to X2 (nom.) or X2 (5%) shortly after plug-in.\n\n2. **EIM Done & Matching Process Started**  \n   - As soon as the EV is plugged in and recognized, the EVSE can begin the EIM procedure (if applicable).  \n   - Once EIM completes, the EVSE and EV can begin the matching process (confirming the EV is ready for high-level communication and/or basic charging).  \n\n3. **Transition to X2 (5% or nom.)**  \n   - The EVSE shifts the control pilot signal to a \u201c5% or nominal\u201d duty cycle.  \n   - This denotes that the system is seeking or has established a \u201cmatched state\u201d and is checking authorization compatibility.\n\n4. **X2 (5% or Nom.) \u201cMatched State\u201d and Authorization OK**  \n   - At this point, the EV and EVSE have confirmed each other\u2019s presence and authorization.  \n   - From here, the diagram specifies the main charging branches.\n\n5. **V2G Setup Finished**  \n   - The high-level communication (ISO 15118) or the matching for basic charging (IEC 61851\u20111) is complete.  \n   - The system is ready to begin energy transfer, subject to the branch chosen (PnC or EIM).\n\n6. **Branches (After V2G Setup Finished)**\n   - **(a) PnC**  \n     1. The EV proceeds under the \u201cPlug & Charge\u201d mechanism.  \n     2. All further charging control is managed by HLC\u2011C (high-level communication).  \n     3. This path is mandatory if the EV and EVSE are both configured for PnC and the user wishes to use it.  \n\n   - **(b) EIM w/ BC**  \n     1. The EV chooses EIM for identification/authorization.  \n     2. The actual charging current (or power) is controlled primarily by Basic Charging (BC) signals per IEC 61851\u20111.  \n     3. Meanwhile, the high-level communication (HLC\u2011C) can still provide additional status or monitoring as necessary, but the main control is BC.  \n\n   - **(c) EIM w/o BC**  \n     1. The EV also uses EIM for identification, but BC is not utilized.  \n     2. The charging is controlled directly by the high-level communication (HLC\u2011C).  \n\n7. **Re-init**  \n   - A trigger condition that resets the process if necessary (for example, if some error occurs or a new cycle starts).  \n   - This can bring the CP signal back to X1 (100%) or the sequence might revert to an earlier step.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection of Entities\n\n- **Control Pilot States (X1, X2)**  \n  - These states represent different duty cycle signals on the control pilot line in accordance with IEC 61851\u20111.  \n  - X1 (100%) may appear at plug-in or during re-initialization.  \n  - X2 (nom.) or X2 (5% or nominal) typically indicates the EVSE is in an active state waiting for or confirming communication or charging readiness.\n\n- **HLC\u2011C and BC**  \n  - These represent two different control planes for charging.  \n    - **HLC\u2011C (High-Level Communication)** follows ISO 15118 protocols for advanced features (e.g., PnC, contract certificates).  \n    - **BC (Basic Charging)** follows the simpler IEC 61851\u20111 approach using the control pilot\u2019s duty cycle to modulate charging current.\n\n- **Trigger Conditions**  \n  - \u201cEIM done & matching process started,\u201d \u201cRe-init,\u201d or \u201cPlug-in\u201d are events that move the system from one state to the next.\n\n- **PnC and EIM**  \n  - **PnC (Plug & Charge)** relies on automatic certificate-based authorization over the HLC connection.  \n  - **EIM (External Identification Means)** typically uses RFID cards, credit cards, or other external methods to authorize charging.\n\n- **NOTE on CP State Usage**  \n  - The chart clarifies that an EVSE may operate in CP state X1 instead of X2 (nom.) for a short time upon plugging in, depending on the implementation and compliance with IEC rules.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\nThis flow chart (often referenced in ISO 15118-3 and related IEC 61851-1 guidelines) illustrates how an AC charging session can be coordinated when both PnC and EIM options are available:\n\n1. EV is plugged in (CP state X1 or X2).  \n2. EIM completes (if used) and the matching/authorization process starts.  \n3. Control pilot transitions to a 5% or nominal duty cycle, indicating a \u201cmatched state.\u201d  \n4. Authorization is confirmed (PnC or EIM).  \n5. V2G Setup finishes.  \n6. Charging proceeds under one of three branches:  \n   - (a) PnC (fully high-level)  \n   - (b) EIM with Basic Charging  \n   - (c) EIM with high-level communication only (no BC).  \n\nAt every step, the chart differentiates **mandatory** arrows (solid) from **possible** (dashed) ones, highlighting which state transitions might be optional under certain system configurations.\n\n---\n\n> **Important Note:**  \n> If an EVSE only supports EIM or only supports PnC, any unused branches in the diagram (e.g., BC or HLC\u2011C) need not be followed. The figure covers the \u201cuniversal\u201d scenario where both are supported and the matching process has already started when EIM is finished.",
    "iso3-image_16.png": "# Detailed Description of the Flow Chart\n\nBelow is a thorough, step-by-step explanation in markdown format, covering all entities, transitions, and notes shown in the figure.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Overview\n\n1. **A**  \n   - Represents an initial state or entry point (before the EV is plugged in or any charging coordination begins).\n\n2. **Plug-in**  \n   - Indicates the action of connecting the EV to the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment).\n\n3. **Re-init**  \n   - Denotes a re-initialization step, potentially triggered if the system needs to restart the setup process.\n\n4. **X2 (nom.)**  \n   - Refers to the nominal Control Pilot (CP) state \u201cX2\u201d as defined in the IEC/ISO standards. This is typically the normal state for AC charging pilot signaling.  \n   - According to the NOTE, \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC-3] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d\n\n5. **X2 (5 % or nom.)**  \n   - A variant on the Control Pilot \u201cX2\u201d state, potentially signifying a reduced PWM duty cycle (e.g., 5% for low-level communication or nominal duty cycle).\n\n6. **b) EIM w. BC**  \n   - A branch indicating External Identification Means (EIM) with Basic Charging (BC).  \n   - \u201cBC\u201d (Basic Charging) is charging controlled by IEC\u202f61851\u20111.\n\n7. **c) EIM w/o BC**  \n   - Another branch indicating EIM but without Basic Charging. Here, charging is controlled by high-level communication (HLC-C).\n\n8. **d) [IEC-1] Charging**  \n   - Represents a standard IEC\u202f61851\u20111 charging process (basic \u201cMode 3\u201d charging), labeled as [IEC\u20111] in the figure.\n\n9. **Trigger condition**  \n   - A condition or event that causes the transition from one control pilot state or step to another.\n\n10. **HLC-C**  \n    - High-Level Communication \u2013 Configuration (or simply High-Level Communication for Charging).  \n    - Indicates that the charging process is coordinated through advanced communication protocols (ISO\u202f15118 / DIN\u202f70121).\n\n11. **BC**  \n    - Basic Charging.  \n    - Charging controlled purely by the IEC\u202f61851\u20111 \u201cMode 3\u201d protocol, without high-level comms.\n\n12. **V2G Setup finished**  \n    - A status showing that all necessary Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) high-level communication steps or matching processes have completed successfully.\n\n13. **NOTE**  \n    - Provides an additional standard-specific note:  \n      \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC-3] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d\n\n14. **Possible procedure** (represented by dashed arrows)  \n    - Indicates paths or transitions that may occur depending on the EVSE/EV implementation but are not strictly mandatory by the standard.\n\n15. **Mandatory procedure** (represented by solid arrows)  \n    - Indicates paths or transitions that must occur to meet the standard requirements.\n\n16. **Refer to IEC 61851\u20111 Ed. 3, A.5**  \n    - This reference points to a specific subclause in IEC\u202f61851\u20111 Edition 3, Annex A.5, which further explains or clarifies the CP states.\n\n17. **Key**  \n    - A legend/guide to the flowchart\u2019s symbols and lines (possible/mandatory procedures, trigger conditions, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)\n\n1. **State A (Idle/Pre-Connection)**  \n   - The dotted line labeled \u201cpossible procedure\u201d leads to the circle marked \u201cA,\u201d showing that the system may start in this idle state or arrive here after a previous cycle.\n\n2. **Transition to \u201cPlug-in\u201d or Re-init**  \n   - From state \u201cA,\u201d two possible (dotted) paths can occur:  \n     1. **Plug-in**: The user connects the EV to the EVSE.  \n     2. **Re-init**: Some systems may need to reset, reinitialize, or re-attempt the procedure.\n\n3. **Arrival at X2 (nom.)**  \n   - Once plugged in or re-initialized, the EVSE sets the control pilot to \u201cX2 (nom.)\u201d (or \u201cX1\u201d if the NOTE is applicable). This is indicated by the solid arrow (mandatory procedure) leading to \u201cX2 (nom.).\u201d\n\n4. **Branch from X2 (nom.)**  \n   - At \u201cX2 (nom.),\u201d the chart shows multiple possible paths depending on whether high-level communication (HLC-C) or basic charging (BC) is being used, and whether External Identification Means (EIM) is required:\n\n   a) **From X2 (nom.) \u2192 X2 (5 % or nom.) with HLC-C \u2192 b) EIM w. BC**  \n      - If EIM is used with Basic Charging, then after V2G setup completion, the system references HLC-C for controlling the process. The duty cycle on the pilot might switch to \u201c5 % or nominal,\u201d and the EVSE is in an EIM mode with BC.  \n      - \u201cBC\u201d then handles charging under IEC\u202f61851\u20111.\n\n   b) **From X2 (nom.) \u2192 X2 (5 % or nom.) with HLC-C \u2192 c) EIM w/o BC**  \n      - Similar to the above, but if Basic Charging is not utilized, the EV/EVSE rely solely on high-level communication. The flow indicates \u201cV2G Setup finished,\u201d leading to EIM without BC.\n\n   c) **From X2 (nom.) \u2192 X2 (nom.) \u2192 d) [IEC-1] Charging**  \n      - If high-level communication is not used or not requested, the diagram references the standard IEC\u202f61851\u20111 charging process directly. This path also indicates that at some point after \u201cX2 (nom.),\u201d the EV goes into normal AC charging according to [IEC-1].\n\n5. **V2G Setup Finished**  \n   - Whenever HLC-C is invoked, the arrow from \u201cHLC-C\u201d shows \u201cV2G Setup finished,\u201d confirming that the vehicle-to-grid communication handshake is complete.\n\n6. **Reference to IEC 61851-1 Ed. 3, A.5**  \n   - The flow returns to \u201cX2 (nom.)\u201d with an accompanying note referencing IEC\u202f61851\u20111 for further details on pilot-state transitions.\n\n7. **NOTE**  \n   - The flow chart includes a note at the bottom clarifying that **CP state X1** may be used in place of **X2 (nom.)** if IEC-3 (Table 5) X1 state usage is applicable. This might occur in certain EVSE/EV configurations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection of Entities\n\n1. **Control Pilot States (\u201cX2(nom.)\u201d or \u201cX2(5% or nom.)\u201d)**  \n   - These states define the level of duty cycle on the control pilot signal, crucial for indicating charging readiness, EIM usage, or high-level communication readiness.\n\n2. **HLC-C (High-Level Communication)**  \n   - When invoked, it coordinates the charging session (e.g., V2G features, advanced authorization, dynamic control). The flow chart clearly shows transitions that involve HLC-C lead to \u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d before actual charging can begin.\n\n3. **BC (Basic Charging)**  \n   - The simpler IEC\u202f61851\u20111\u2013based control method, either used alone ([IEC-1] path) or in conjunction with EIM (b) EIM w. BC).\n\n4. **EIM w. BC vs. EIM w/o BC**  \n   - EIM (External Identification Means) can be combined with basic signaling or purely high-level communications. The diagram shows these two distinct branches:  \n     - **b) EIM w. BC:** EIM authentication plus IEC\u202f61851\u20111.  \n     - **c) EIM w/o BC:** EIM authentication and purely HLC-based control.\n\n5. **Trigger Conditions**  \n   - The arrows labeled with trigger conditions indicate transitions that depend on completing setup steps (e.g., \u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d or successful EIM). They show how the system might jump from \u201cX2(nom.)\u201d to \u201cX2(5% or nom.)\u201d or remain at \u201cX2(nom.)\u201d for traditional IEC\u202f61851\u20111 charging.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Additional Notes & References\n\n- **NOTE on CP state X1**:  \n  \u201cCP state X1 is allowed instead of X2 (nom.) following [IEC-3] (Table 5, X1 state usage).\u201d Depending on the EVSE implementation, the initial pilot state right after plug-in may be X1 rather than X2(nom.).\n\n- **IEC 61851-1 Ed. 3, A.5**:  \n  Additional details for CP signal definitions, pilot states, and the behavior in normal or reduced pilot duty cycles can be found in Annex A.5 of the third edition of IEC\u202f61851\u20111.\n\n- **High-Level Communication**:  \n  Typically refers to ISO\u202f15118 (PnC, Plug-and-Charge) or DIN\u202f70121-based solutions that enable advanced negotiation, payment handling, and bidirectional (V2G) features.\n\n- **Basic Charging**:  \n  Follows the simple IEC\u202f61851\u20111 conduction-based control pilot methodology without advanced communication.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis flow chart depicts how an AC EVSE supporting high-level communication (HLC-C) and/or basic charging (BC) transitions through its control pilot states and procedures once an EV is plugged in (or re-initialized). The diagram includes multiple branches for External Identification Means (EIM) with or without BC, as well as a direct [IEC-1] charging path. Each step\u2014plug-in, re-init, moving from A state to X2(nom.), optionally switching to X2(5% or nom.), completing V2G setup, and beginning charging\u2014corresponds to specific control pilot and communication states. The note clarifies that X1 can stand in for X2(nom.) in certain implementations per IEC-3.",

Flow of the Diagram\n\n### 2.1 Top Branch \u2014 (a) PnC Scenario\n1. **Plug\u2011in**  \n   - The driver (or automated system) physically connects the DC charging cable to the vehicle.  \n2. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   - Immediately after plug\u2011in, the control pilot may be at state X1 or X2 with a 5\u202f% duty cycle, indicating that the EVSE is awaiting identification and/or handshake.  \n3. **Transition to X2 (5%)**  \n   - The system (EV and EVSE) settles at a 5\u202f% duty cycle for further communication.  \n4. **V2G Setup started**  \n   - High\u2011level communication begins (ISO\u202f15118 protocol handshake).  \n5. **V2G Setup finished**  \n   - The handshake completes successfully. The system is now ready for controlled charging.  \n6. **HLC\u2011C**  \n   - The ongoing charging session is controlled by high\u2011level communication (\u201cHLC\u2011C\u201d).  \n7. **Final Arrow to \u201cPnC\u201d**  \n   - The diagram labels this entire scenario under \u201c(a) PnC,\u201d emphasizing that Plug and Charge identification was used.\n\n### 2.2 Middle Branch \u2014 (c) EIM Scenario (EIM after Plug\u2011In)\n1. **Plug\u2011in**  \n   - The operator connects the vehicle to the DC charger.  \n2. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   - Immediately sees the control pilot in a 5\u202f% duty cycle state, awaiting identification or handshake.  \n3. **Transition to X2 (5%)**  \n   - The control pilot stabilizes at X2 (5\u202f%).  \n4. **V2G Setup started**  \n   - The vehicle\u2011to\u2011grid communication handshake is initiated.  \n5. **V2G Setup finished**  \n   - The handshake concludes successfully.  \n6. **HLC\u2011C**  \n   - Charging is now under high\u2011level communication control.  \n7. **Final Arrow to \u201cc) EIM\u201d**  \n   - The scenario is labeled \u201c(c) EIM,\u201d indicating that the system uses an external identification means.  \n   - Notably, the figure suggests that the EIM steps occur in or after the plug\u2011in event (rather than beforehand).\n\n### 2.3 Bottom Branch \u2014 (c) EIM Scenario (EIM before Plug\u2011In)\n1. **EIM**  \n   - External identification means is carried out **before** physically plugging in the vehicle.  \n2. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   - The EVSE (or user interface) is in a state where it allows external ID, possibly at a 5\u202f% duty cycle without the EV physically connected.  \n3. **Plug\u2011in**  \n   - The user then plugs in the vehicle.  \n4. **X1 or X2 (5%)**  \n   - Once again, the control pilot is at 5\u202f% duty cycle after plug\u2011in, still coordinating identification if needed.  \n5. **Re\u2011init**  \n   - The system triggers a re\u2011initialization of the communication if required (for example, if the plug\u2011in event occurred after some EIM steps).  \n6. **V2G Setup started**  \n   - The vehicle and EVSE begin the ISO\u202f15118 handshake.  \n7. **X2 (5%)**  \n   - The control pilot is confirmed at X2 with a 5\u202f% duty cycle while the V2G communication is in progress.  \n8. **V2G Setup finished**  \n   - Handshake completes; the EV and EVSE are ready for managed charging.  \n9. **HLC\u2011C**  \n   - High\u2011level communication is actively controlling the charging session.  \n10. **Final Arrow to \u201cc) EIM\u201d**  \n   - Again, labeled \u201c(c) EIM,\u201d but this time with the identification finished **before** the plug\u2011in event.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relationship and Connection of Entities\n\n- **\u201cPlug\u2011in\u201d** is the physical action that introduces the vehicle to the EVSE. In two of the branches (top and middle), EIM/PnC is effectively happening right after or during plug\u2011in. In the bottom branch, **EIM** occurs **before** the user physically connects the vehicle.  \n- **\u201cX1 or X2 (5%)\u201d** stands for specific control pilot states. The 5\u202f% duty cycle often indicates a waiting or authorization phase. The chart consistently shows these states around the plug\u2011in and re\u2011init events.  \n- **\u201cV2G Setup started\u201d** and **\u201cV2G Setup finished\u201d** encapsulate the ISO\u202f15118 handshake. Once V2G setup finishes, the charger transitions to **HLC\u2011C** (high\u2011level communication control).  \n- **\u201cRe\u2011init\u201d** can happen if the system needs to restart or re\u2011establish the communication sequence for any reason (for instance, if the user performed EIM prior to plug\u2011in).  \n- **\u201cPnC\u201d** is one type of identification method; **\u201cEIM\u201d** is another. Figure\u202f8 illustrates how a DC EVSE can handle both PnC and EIM in multiple possible sequences.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Multiple Identification Methods:** The figure highlights that DC charging can be initiated with either PnC or EIM (or both), and the sequence of EIM can vary (before or after plug\u2011in).  \n2. **Control Pilot States (X1/X2 at 5\u202f%):** The 5\u202f% duty cycle is a critical indication that the system is in a hold or handshake\u2011awaiting state.  \n3. **V2G Setup Flow:** Each branch confirms that once the vehicle is plugged in and identification is complete (via either PnC or EIM), the V2G communication handshake starts, finishes, and hands over to **HLC\u2011C** for managing the charging.  \n4. **Re\u2011init Step:** Illustrates that if the sequence is interrupted or the vehicle or EVSE requires a fresh handshake (e.g., after an EIM step), they re\u2011initialize the communication before proceeding with V2G Setup.  \n\nBy following these flow steps, engineers and implementers can quickly understand how a DC EVSE (supporting ISO\u202f15118) handles both **PnC** and **EIM** identification methods under different timing scenarios.",
    "iso3-image_18.png": "# Detailed Description of Figure 10 \u2014 EV Point of View (Matching Process)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step walkthrough of the flowchart. The diagram illustrates how an Electric Vehicle (EV) determines the correct Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) connection (i.e., \u201cmatching\u201d) based on discovery, signal strength measurements, possible validation, and ultimately setting up or failing to set up a data link.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

(found / not found)**  \n    - After attempting validation, the EV either confirms or rejects the EVSE.  \n    - If confirmed \u2192 proceed to network setup.  \n    - If rejected \u2192 proceed to \u201cnext EVSE\u201d or declare no link.\n\n15. **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  \n    - If more than one EVSE was discovered and not yet validated, the EV can continue validating in sequence.\n\n16. **next EVSE**  \n    - The EV moves to another candidate EVSE and repeats the validation step.\n\n17. **Setup logical network**  \n    - If the EV is satisfied with the discovered/validated EVSE, it sets up the logical (data link) communication network with that EVSE.\n\n18. **Data link established?**  \n    - Checks whether the EV has successfully established the data link (i.e., the communication session and all necessary transport layers).\n\n19. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)**  \n    - Indicates to higher-layer entities (HLE) that a data link is set up (matching is successful).  \n    - From here, upper layers continue the binding process outlined in ISO 15118-3.\n\n20. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)**  \n    - Indicates that no valid data link is available (matching has failed).  \n    - The process can exit, and higher layers are notified that no link was established.\n\n21. **Exit matching process with success / failure**  \n    - Final outcome: the EV is either matched or not matched to an EVSE.\n\n22. **NOTE**  \n    - \u201cError handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)\n\n1. **Entering matching process**  \n   The EV transitions into the matching phase (often triggered by a control pilot transition to an active charging state).\n\n2. **Discovery of the connected communication nodes**  \n   - The EV enumerates all communication nodes visible on the physical link.  \n   - Multiple EVSEs may be detected (e.g., in scenarios with cross-talk).\n\n3. **Signal strength measurement**  \n   - The EV measures how strongly each communication node\u2019s signal is received.\n\n4. **Signal strength analysis**  \n   - The EV compares measured signals. Three possible outcomes:  \n     a) **Low signal attenuation** \u2192 strong signal from one node.  \n     b) **Ambiguous result** \u2192 multiple nodes with uncertain or similarly strong signals.  \n     c) **High signal attenuation** \u2192 no suitable (or extremely weak) signals.\n\n5. **Branching into three results**  \n   - If **low signal attenuation** is observed:  \n     \u2192 The EV sets **Result = \u201cEVSE_FOUND.\u201d**  \n   - If **ambiguous** measurement is observed:  \n     \u2192 The EV sets **Result = \u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND.\u201d**  \n   - If **high signal attenuation** is observed:  \n     \u2192 The EV sets **Result = \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND.\u201d**\n\n6. **Result is \u201cEVSE_FOUND\u201d**  \n   - Optionally, the EV may do a sanity/validation check (depending on the scenario).  \n   - Otherwise, it can declare final result as \u201cEVSE_FOUND\u201d and proceed.\n\n   **Declared result is \u201cEVSE_FOUND\u201d**  \n   \u2192 Next step: **Setup logical network**.\n\n7. **Result is \u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND\u201d**  \n   - The EV might treat it as \u201cEVSE_FOUND\u201d or \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND,\u201d or it can continue with an actual **Validation of matching decision**.  \n   - If it decides not to validate further (per system rules), it may directly set \u201cDeclared result is \u2018EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND\u2019\u201d and treat it accordingly.  \n   - Otherwise, proceed to the next diamond: **Validation of matching decision**.\n\n8. **Result is \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND\u201d**  \n   - If the EV cannot identify a valid EVSE, or the signal is too weak to be recognized, the EV declares \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND.\u201d  \n   - **Declared result is \u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND.\u201d**  \n   - This immediately leads to the EV calling **D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** and exiting the process (with failure).\n\n9. **Validation of matching decision** (found on the \u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND\u201d path or optionally on the \u201cEVSE_FOUND\u201d path)  \n   - The EV requests (and performs) additional confirmation with the EVSE (for instance, using the control pilot \u201cBCB-Toggle\u201d procedure mentioned in Clause 9.4).  \n   - **Validation result?**  \n     1. **found**: The EV confirms the EVSE is correct. Proceed to \u201cSetup logical network.\u201d  \n     2. **not found**: The EV rejects this EVSE, checks if there is a **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  \n        - If **yes**, go to **next EVSE** and repeat.  \n        - If **no**, proceed to \u201cCall D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)\u201d (failure).\n\n10. **Setup logical network**  \n    - Once certain of the correct EVSE, the EV sets up the low-level communication (logical network).  \n    - **Data link established?**  \n      - If **yes** \u2192 **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)** \u2192 exit with success.  \n      - If **no** \u2192 **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** \u2192 exit with failure.\n\n11. **Exit matching process**  \n    - Either as a success (the EV is matched and ready for higher-layer communication) or as a failure (no valid link or incorrect EVSE discovered).\n\n12. **NOTE**  \n    - \u201cError handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.\u201d The figure omits certain fallback or error paths (e.g., hardware faults) that are described in Annex A.9.8 in the standard.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection Among Entities\n\n1. **EV** \u2013 The primary actor performing discovery, measurement, and analysis.  \n2. **Communication Nodes** (EVSEs) \u2013 Possible candidates that the EV might be physically attached to.  \n3. **Signal Strength Measurement** \u2013 Core step for determining whether the EV has a strong enough link to confirm \u201cEVSE_FOUND,\u201d or if there is ambiguity (\u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND\u201d), or if no match can be made (\u201cEVSE_NOT_FOUND\u201d).  \n4. **Validation Process** \u2013 A separate (optional or required) mechanism that uses control pilot line toggles to double-check the physical wiring.  \n5. **Logical Network Setup** \u2013 The bridging or data-layer step established once the EV confidently decides on an EVSE.  \n6. **D-LINK_READY.ind** \u2013 The primitive called to indicate either a successful link or a failed link to the higher layers.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Additional Notes from ISO 15118-3\n\n- **Under ambiguous conditions** (\u201cEVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND\u201d), an EV may ask the EVSE to confirm the connection via a separate pilot-line validation.  \n- **Error handling** is largely omitted in Figure 10; full details appear in Annex A.9.8.  \n- **Any transition**\u2014whether success or failure\u2014results in calling D-LINK_READY.IND to notify higher layers.  \n- **According to Annex 9.5**, once the logical network is successfully set up, the status changes to \u201cMatched\u201d and upper-layer protocols (e.g., TLS, V2G messages) can begin binding.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFigure 10 (EV point of view) outlines how the EV:  \n1) **Discovers** possible EVSE nodes,  \n2) **Measures** and **analyzes** each node\u2019s signal strength,  \n3) **Determines** whether a single, multiple, or zero EVSEs are valid matches,  \n4) **Optionally validates** ambiguous results,  \n5) **Sets up** a logical network with the matched EVSE, and  \n6) **Exits** by either calling \u201cD-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)\u201d for success or \u201cD-LINK_READY.IND (No link)\u201d for failure.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures the EV consistently identifies the correct EVSE in multi-charger environments and starts a reliable higher-level communication session for the charging process.",
    "iso3-image_19.png": "## Figure A.10 \u2014 Implementation of Parallel Injection\n\nBelow is a detailed description of each labeled element in the schematic and how they interconnect. Although this figure is presented as a circuit diagram (rather than a traditional \u201cflowchart\u201d), the step-by-step structure below will help you follow the signal path and understand how each component relates to the others. This diagram shows how HomePlug Green PHY signals are injected in parallel (between the Control Pilot line and ground/earth) for communication between the EVSE and EV.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Entities Overview\n\n1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)**  \n   The left rectangular region represents the EVSE side. It provides the \u00b112\u202fV, 1\u202fkHz control pilot signal, measures voltage on the pilot line, injects and receives PLC (Power Line Communication) signals via a Green PHY modem, and references Earth (ground).\n\n2. **EV (Electric Vehicle)**  \n   The right rectangular region is the EV side. It also includes a Green PHY modem and supporting components for parallel injection and measurement of the control pilot signal (duty cycle and frequency). The EV\u2019s contactors and internal circuitry ultimately use the pilot to detect charging states and enable communication.\n\n3. **Oscillator \u00b112\u202fV, 1\u202fkHz (Key #2)**  \n   Generates the low-frequency (1\u202fkHz) PWM control pilot signal. This signal is crucial for basic control pilot functions prescribed by IEC\u202f61851 (e.g., indicating EV readiness or maximum current availability).\n\n4. **Pilot Contact (Key #3)**  \n   The pilot contact is effectively the point where the EVSE\u2019s control pilot line is physically connected to the corresponding pilot input on the EV side (through the charging cable and coupler).\n\n5. **R1 1\u202fk (on EVSE side)**  \n   A series resistor (1\u202fk\u03a9) connected to the oscillator output. It helps set the correct pilot voltage levels and limits current.\n\n6. **C_S (on EVSE side)**  \n   Often called the \u201ccontrol pilot capacitor\u201d in IEC\u202fstandards. It shapes the pilot signal to comply with specific requirements and influences the total capacitive behavior on the pilot line.\n\n7. **Green PHY Modems (Key #5)**  \n   Both the EVSE and EV sides include a Green PHY modem. These modems handle high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) communication on top of the pilot line. Each modem is shown in a dashed box on both sides (the rectangle labeled \u201c5\u201d).\n\n8. **R_damp (Damping Resistor) and L (Inductor)**  \n   Each side has an R_damp and L in series, forming part of the low-pass filter for the pilot signal (the LC network) and a high-pass path for the HomePlug Green PHY signals. R_damp prevents or limits resonance in the LC filter.\n\n9. **C_PLC (Coupling Capacitors to the Green PHY Modem)**  \n   These capacitors provide a high-frequency coupling path for the Green PHY signals from the pilot line into the modem, while isolating low-frequency or DC components.\n\n10. **C_v (EV side)**  \n   Defined in IEC documents, C_v is another capacitor related to the detection/measuring circuit inside the EV, usually affecting pilot line diagnostics or measurements.\n\n11. **R2, R3, and S2 (EV side)**  \n   \u2014 **R2 and R3**: Resistors on the EV side pilot circuitry, used for pilot line detection, current sensing, or dividing voltages for pilot sensing.  \n   \u2014 **S2**: A switch (or contact) that can open/close for pilot line control or internal EV states.\n\n12. **Voltage Measurement (Key #1)**  \n   Indicates that the EVSE side monitors pilot voltage levels for compliance with control pilot specifications (e.g., states A, B, C in IEC\u202f61851).\n\n13. **Earth (ground) (Key #4)**  \n   The reference earth or protective earth (PE). The high-frequency signal is injected between the pilot line and earth/ground. This ensures the HomePlug Green PHY signals have a proper return path.\n\n14. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (Key #6)**  \n   On the EV side, the duty cycle and frequency measurement block monitors the PWM characteristics of the pilot signal (i.e., the 1\u202fkHz, \u00b112\u202fV waveform) to interpret the EVSE\u2019s indication of available current and other pilot states.\n\n15. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  \n   Shown as a dashed region, these might include filters, ESD protection, or EMC compliance parts. They should not degrade the HomePlug Green PHY signals beyond stated limits.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Signal Flow and Connections\n\nEven though this is a circuit schematic rather than a traditional flowchart, we can describe how signals traverse or how each function occurs in succession:\n\n1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  \n   - The **oscillator (\u00b112\u202fV, 1\u202fkHz)** produces the control pilot waveform.  \n   - The pilot waveform goes through **R1 (1\u202fk\u03a9)** and **C_S**, shaping the signal and ensuring correct amplitude as per IEC requirements.\n\n2. **Pilot Line Connection to Green PHY Modem (EVSE side)**  \n   - The **pilot line** is also branched through the **LC filter** formed by **L** (inductor) and **R_damp** (damping resistor) to the **C_PLC** capacitor.  \n   - **C_PLC** feeds the **Green PHY modem**, allowing high-frequency components (the HPGP signal) to pass to/from the modem but blocking the lower-frequency 1\u202fkHz pilot wave from saturating the modem.\n\n3. **Voltage Measurement (EVSE side)**  \n   - The EVSE monitors the pilot voltage (labeled Key #1) to verify pilot states, detect EV presence, and measure any duty cycle references required by the standard.\n\n4. **Pilot Contact (Connector) Between EVSE and EV (Key #3)**  \n   - The pilot line physically transitions from the EVSE circuit to the EV circuit at the **pilot contact**. This is typically inside the charging cable and coupler.\n\n5. **Green PHY Parallel Injection Path to Earth (EV Side)**  \n   - On reaching the EV side, the pilot line splits:  \n     - One path continues into the EV\u2019s measurement and pilot control logic (through R3, R2, and possibly S2).  \n     - Another path branches through another LC filter stage (**L**, **R_damp**, **C_PLC**) to the **Green PHY modem** on the EV side. The parallel injection is again between the pilot line and **earth/ground**.  \n   - The diode shown in the pilot line (on the EV side) can be part of the standard pilot detection or protective circuitry.\n\n6. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (EV side, Key #6)**  \n   - The EV needs to interpret the EVSE\u2019s PWM signal to understand the available current or states (A, B, C, etc.). Thus, there is a block that directly measures the pilot\u2019s duty cycle and frequency once it has passed through the EV\u2019s front-end components.\n\n7. **S2 (EV side switch)**  \n   - **S2** may engage or disengage certain parts of the EV\u2019s pilot circuitry, depending on the EV\u2019s state (e.g., if the EV is ready to charge or certain fault conditions). When closed, the pilot circuit is fully connected; when open, the pilot circuit is interrupted.\n\n8. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  \n   - Finally, any **additional PLC coupling** components (EMC filters, ESD protection, etc.) are placed so they do not adversely affect the high-frequency Green PHY signals or the low-frequency pilot signal. They must maintain compliance with the emission and immunity constraints (A.10 EMC requirements and others cited in ISO\u202f15118-3).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Relationship and Purpose of Each Section\n\n- **Low-Frequency Pilot Signal Path (1\u202fkHz)**  \n  Passes through R1, C_S, the pilot contact, R2, R3, and S2 (when closed). The EVSE and EV measure this pilot for verifying connection status, charging states, and maximum current availability.\n\n- **High-Frequency Communication Path (HomePlug Green PHY)**  \n  Injected in parallel to earth at both the EVSE and EV sides via the LC filters (L, R_damp, and C_PLC). These filters isolate the 1\u202fkHz pilot wave from the modem but allow the higher-frequency data signals to travel between the two Green PHY modems.\n\n- **Filtering and EMC Considerations**  \n  Inductors, damping resistors, and capacitors create low-pass filtering for pilot signals and high-pass filtering for the PLC signals. This design ensures that high-frequency data does not overly distort the control pilot, while the pilot line remains within standard requirements (IEC\u202f61851, ISO\u202f15118-3, etc.).\n\n- **Measurement Points**  \n  Key #1 (voltage measurement) and Key #6 (duty cycle/frequency measurement) denote where the EVSE and EV measure the pilot signal. In each case, there may be a low-pass filter recommended to remove the high-frequency components from the measurement path (per the notes in ISO\u202f15118-3).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Summary\n\nFigure\u202fA.10 demonstrates an example implementation of \u201cparallel injection\u201d for HomePlug Green PHY signals onto the control pilot line:\n\n- The **EVSE** supplies the main pilot signal via an oscillator and monitors pilot voltage.  \n- **Parallel injection** ensures both the EVSE and EV couple the high-frequency Green PHY signals between the pilot and ground.  \n- **Low-pass + high-pass filtering** (with L, R_damp, and capacitors) allows the 1\u202fkHz pilot control signal to pass unimpeded while at the same time guiding the high-frequency Green PHY data to each modem.  \n- **Duty-cycle/frequency measurements** are taken by both sides (the EVSE monitors the raw pilot voltage; the EV monitors duty cycle) while the high-frequency data is superimposed.  \n\nThrough these components and connections, the system meets the dual requirements of standard pilot signaling (for charging states) and HomePlug Green PHY communication (for vehicle-to-grid data exchange) on the same control pilot conductor.",

It illustrates the layered network architecture, culminating in interfaces that connect to higher-level protocols (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network) and basic signaling (Control Pilot) as specified in IEC\u202f61851\u20111.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step, layer-by-layer description of each entity in the figure and how they relate to each other.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Overview\n\nFrom **bottom** to **top**, the following entities appear in the diagram:\n\n1. **Communication media**  \n   The physical medium (the cable assembly) through which signals and energy are exchanged between the Electric Vehicle (EV) and the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).\n\n2. **Signal coupling**  \n   This represents the method of coupling the PLC (Power Line Communication) signal onto the AC or DC charging cable. It ensures the high-frequency PLC signal is injected or extracted without interfering with the power transfer itself.\n\n3. **PLC Physical layer**  \n   The physical layer of the Power Line Communication (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY). It defines the electrical and modulation specifications required to transmit bits over the communication media.\n\n4. **MAC/PHY SAP**  \n   The Service Access Point between the PHY (Physical) and MAC (Medium Access Control) layers. It represents the interface through which the upper layer (MAC) exchanges data and control information with the physical layer.\n\n5. **PLC MAC layer**  \n   The Medium Access Control layer that handles packet framing, addressing, and channel-access mechanisms specific to PLC (e.g., carrier-sense multiple access, collision avoidance, etc.).\n\n6. **Convergence MAC SAP**  \n   The interface between the PLC MAC layer and the convergence layer. It ensures that data from higher-layer protocols is properly formatted for MAC-layer transmission and vice versa.\n\n7. **Convergence layer**  \n   A bridging layer that adapts the classic OSI Data Link\u2013level services (like Ethernet bridging or VLAN tagging) into the specific requirements/format of the PLC protocols. It converges or translates data to align with HomePlug GreenPHY or other PLC standards.\n\n8. **Control SAP**  \n   A specialized Service Access Point providing a control interface for the PLC or other network-management functions (e.g., encryption key management, SLAC services, link status queries). This is used by upper software modules that need direct PLC-related control/configuration.\n\n9. **Data link control SAP**  \n   An interface that provides link-status information, error management, and other data link control functionalities. This SAP ties the connection coordination module to the lower-level Data Link functionalities.\n\n10. **Connection coordination**  \n   A functional block that coordinates establishing or tearing down logical connections. It helps with matching EVs to EVSEs, exchanging handshake signals, and managing the relationship between basic IEC\u202f61851-1 signaling and the higher, logical data connections of ISO\u202f15118.\n\n11. **Data SAP**  \n   The interface between the Data Link layer and the Network (layer\u202f3) or higher layers for actual V2G (vehicle-to-grid) data exchange. All high-level charging messages (e.g., those required by ISO\u202f15118-2) flow through the Data SAP.\n\n12. **Higher layers**  \n   In OSI terms, these encapsulate the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, and Network layers. ISO\u202f15118-2 typically operates at these layers (exchanging XML messages, session management, security, etc.).\n\n13. **Control pilot (IEC\u202f61851-1) Hardware I/Os**  \n   Shown to the right, this denotes the separate hardware line(s) used for \u201cbasic signaling\u201d (PWM duty cycle, pilot states, etc.). It is not strictly part of the PLC communication stack but interplays with it (for example, telling the EV and EVSE when to begin or end coupling for high-level communication).\n\n14. **OSI reference model layers**  \n   A vertical bracket on the left reminding us that Physical and Data Link layers in the OSI model are here implemented by the PLC layers and the \u201cconvergence layer.\u201d\n\n15. **Key**: \u201ccovered by communication technology specification\u201d  \n   The figure highlights (in gray) the parts (Convergence layer, PLC MAC, PLC PHY, etc.) that are defined by specific communication technology standards (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY, IEEE\u202f1901\u202fProfile\u202fGreenPHY).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Detailed Layer-by-Layer Explanation and \u201cFlow\u201d\n\nAlthough this is not a conventional \u201cflowchart,\u201d the diagram can be read from the **Physical** layer at the bottom to the **Application** layer at the top to understand how data flows and which components interact:\n\n1. **Communication Media (Bottom Layer)**  \n   \u2022 Power cabling used for vehicle charging is also used to carry data signals.  \n   \u2022 Power is transferred from the EVSE to the EV; meanwhile, high-frequency signals are superimposed for data exchange.\n\n2. **Signal Coupling Layer**  \n   \u2022 Couples the PLC signal on top of the AC or DC power line.  \n   \u2022 Ensures minimal interference and correct impedance matching to pass data effectively between EV and EVSE.\n\n3. **PLC Physical Layer**  \n   \u2022 Responsible for modulating and demodulating waveforms on the power line.  \n   \u2022 Follows standards such as HomePlug GreenPHY for robust physical signaling (e.g., OFDM, error correction).\n\n4. **MAC/PHY SAP**  \n   \u2022 Logical interface that the MAC layer uses to send and receive frames (bits, symbols) via the Physical layer.  \n   \u2022 Transmits or receives packets after being encoded/decoded at the PHY.\n\n5. **PLC MAC Layer**  \n   \u2022 Implements media access rules (channel sensing, collision avoidance, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Adds header/trailer fields managing addressing and error detection.  \n   \u2022 Manages bridging to upper or lower layers via convergence sub-layers.\n\n6. **Convergence MAC SAP**  \n   \u2022 Provides a standardized interface for the next layer (Convergence layer) to get data from MAC frames.  \n   \u2022 Ensures correct framing and token passing between the Convergence and MAC layers.\n\n7. **Convergence Layer**  \n   \u2022 Adapts the PLC MAC frames into a more generic data link structure or vice versa.  \n   \u2022 Potentially includes bridging or VLAN tagging for IP-based or ISO\u202f15118-2 application data.  \n   \u2022 At this layer, the system transitions from technology-specific data link frames to a more general data link service usable by higher protocols.\n\n8. **Control SAP**  \n   \u2022 A specialized side-interface that configuration/control processes (like encryption-key management or the SLAC process used for EV\u2013EVSE association) can call.  \n   \u2022 Enables reading/writing certain parameters in the PLC MAC or PHY, including link status, encryption keys, and networking specifics.\n\n9. **Data Link Control SAP**  \n   \u2022 Presents data link status (connected, disconnected, error) and handles command signals for enabling or disabling link functionalities.  \n   \u2022 Ties in to the Connection Coordination function, letting higher-layer logic know about link conditions.\n\n10. **Connection Coordination**  \n    \u2022 Supervises or orchestrates which link or channel is used, how the handshake or matching occurs, and whether the EV and EVSE are \u201cpaired.\u201d  \n    \u2022 Tightly integrated with basic signaling from IEC\u202f61851-1 (Control Pilot) and high-level communication from ISO\u202f15118-2.\n\n11. **Data SAP**  \n    \u2022 The normal \u201cdata\u201d interface for exchanging V2G protocol payloads (e.g., charging session requests, contract identification) between the Data Link layer and the higher OSI layers (Network and above).  \n    \u2022 Actual ISO\u202f15118-2 messages pass through this Data SAP after being encapsulated into MAC frames.\n\n12. **Higher Layers**  \n    \u2022 Spanning OSI Layers 3 to 7 (Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).  \n    \u2022 In the context of ISO\u202f15118, these higher layers format, encrypt, and interpret the actual \u201cplug-and-charge\u201d or \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d messages.\n\n13. **Control Pilot (IEC\u202f61851-1) Hardware I/Os**  \n    \u2022 Shown on the right side as a separate domain.  \n    \u2022 Provides basic PWM signaling to indicate EV states, EVSE states, maximum current capability, presence of the EV, or charging fault conditions.  \n    \u2022 Ties into overall Connection Coordination to start or stop the PLC communication as required by the standard.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relationship and Connection of Entities\n\n- **Physical to MAC**  \n  Data moves from the **Communication media** (power lines) through **Signal coupling** into the **PLC Physical layer**, which transmits/receives bits. The **MAC/PHY SAP** is then used to pass frames to/from the **PLC MAC layer**.\n\n- **MAC to Convergence**  \n  The **PLC MAC layer** sends or receives data frames to the **Convergence layer** through the **Convergence MAC SAP**. At this stage, commands and bridging logic are aligned with the needs of higher-level protocols.\n\n- **Convergence to Higher Protocols**  \n  After the Convergence layer, there are multiple SAPs:\n  1. **Control SAP** for direct PLC control and configuration queries (e.g., security keys, link info).  \n  2. **Data Link Control SAP** for controlling the link status, error notifications, and link enable/disable.  \n  3. **Data SAP** for normal data traffic that flows up to the OSI Network or Transport layers.\n\n- **Coordination with Basic Signaling**  \n  The **Connection coordination** block leverages the **Control SAP** and **Data link control SAP** to manage the handshake between the EV and EVSE at both the PLC level and the basic PWM signaling level. Meanwhile, the **Control pilot** line (IEC\u202f61851-1) physically coordinates the presence detection and permissible current via the duty cycle.\n\n- **Higher Layers**  \n  Above the **Data SAP**, normal IP networking (or the ISO\u202f15118-2 application messages) can proceed. These higher-layer protocols rely on the data path established at lower layers by the PLC system and are orchestrated by the **Connection coordination** function.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Layered Architecture**  \n   The figure highlights how the Physical and Data Link layers of ISO\u202f15118\u20113 map directly onto the OSI reference model. The \u201cconvergence layer\u201d ensures that higher layers can remain mostly independent of the underlying PLC technology.\n\n2. **Control vs. Data**  \n   Two main SAP families exist:  \n   - **Control SAP / Data Link Control SAP**: For link management, error reporting, and secure network configuration.  \n   - **Data SAP**: For passing normal application data (ISO\u202f15118-2 messages) to the upper layers.\n\n3. **Basic Signaling Integration**  \n   IEC\u202f61851-1\u2019s control pilot is shown outside the PLC stack, yet it is integral to \u201cConnection coordination,\u201d ensuring correct startup, safety interlocks, and fallback charging states.\n\n4. **Covered by Communication Technology Specification**  \n   The gray regions (Convergence layer, MAC, PHY) are implementations guided by specific PLC standards (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY). They are thus \u201ccovered by communication technology specification.\u201d\n\nBy understanding each block and interface, engineers can quickly trace how signals and data flow from the power line (physical) up to the ISO\u202f15118 application protocol, and how the system coordinates the link state with basic pilot signaling.\n```",
    "iso3-image_21.png": "# Detailed Description of Figure A.11 \u2014 HomePlug Green PHY-Transmission Path Example\n\nBelow is a comprehensive description of the flow chart shown in \u201cFigure A.11 \u2014 HomePlug Green PHY-Transmission path example with SLAC relevant attenuations and calculations.\u201d The diagram illustrates how the Power Line Communication (PLC) signal (M-Sound, in this context) travels from the Electric Vehicle (EV) side to the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) side, with all the associated insertion losses, power spectral densities (PSDs), and measurement steps.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entities Overview\n\n1. **PLC node EV**  \n   - Houses a Green PHY modem.  \n   - Has two paths connected to the modem:  \n     - Rx-Path AttnRxEV (receiving path insertion loss).  \n     - Tx-Path AttnTxEV (transmitting path insertion loss).\n\n2. **Charge cord (AttnCord)**  \n   - The physical charging cable between the EV and the EVSE.  \n   - It introduces its own insertion loss to the signal.\n\n3. **PLC node EVSE**  \n   - Also houses a Green PHY modem on the EVSE side.  \n   - Has two paths connected to the modem:  \n     - Rx-Path AttnRxEVSE (receiving path insertion loss).  \n     - Tx-Path AttnTxEVSE (transmitting path insertion loss).\n\n4. **PSD of M-Sound along the transmission path**  \n   - Shows the power spectral density at various points from EV to EVSE:  \n     - PSD at the EV modem transmitter output.  \n     - PSD at the EV socket.  \n     - PSD at the EVSE socket.  \n     - PSD at the EVSE modem input.\n\n5. **SLAC Measurement**  \n   - Refers to the Signal Level Attenuation Characterization measurement.  \n   - Uses a reference PSD of \u221250 dBm/Hz.  \n   - The EVSE corrects the measured values by adding back AttnRxEVSE (its insertion loss) before reporting to the EV.\n\n6. **Attenuation for Matching Decision**  \n   - A procedure to determine the final attenuation value by comparing reported attenuation values against a reference PSD (\u221226 dB in the example).  \n   - Averaged over all relevant carrier groups.\n\n7. **Reported Attenuation**  \n   - The final attenuation reported (e.g., \u201c\u221228 dB\u201d) is the per-carrier-group attenuation, factoring in EVSE\u2019s internal correction.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)\n\nThe flow chart is read primarily from left to right (EV side to EVSE side), with a bottom branch showing how the SLAC measurement and final attenuation decisions are derived.\n\n1. **PSD at Trncv Output (EV side)**  \n   - The Green PHY modem inside the EV transmits the signal at a power spectral density of **\u221272 dBm/Hz**.  \n   - This output is labeled \u201cPSD of M-Sound along the transmission path from EV to EVSE.\u201d\n\n2. **\u2212AttnTxEV**  \n   - The transmitting path on the EV side (Tx-Path AttnTxEV) incurs an insertion loss (example: ~4 dB).  \n   - After subtracting this loss, the resulting PSD at the EV socket is **\u221276 dBm/Hz** (the \u201cdesign target\u201d).\n\n3. **Passing Through Charge Cord (\u2212AttnCord)**  \n   - The charge cord itself (AttnCord) further attenuates the signal.  \n   - The PSD at the EVSE socket becomes **\u221278 dBm/Hz**.\n\n4. **\u2212AttnRxEVSE**  \n   - On the EVSE side, the receiving path (Rx-Path AttnRxEVSE) imposes an additional insertion loss (example: ~3 dB).  \n   - The PSD finally arrives at the EVSE modem input at **\u221281 dBm/Hz**.\n\n5. **SLAC Measurement**  \n   - The EVSE performs a SLAC measurement referencing **\u221250 dBm/Hz** as a baseline.  \n   - The raw measurement (labeled \u201c\u221231 dB\u201d) represents how much the EVSE side sees relative to \u221250 dBm/Hz.\n\n6. **Correction of Insertion Loss (AttnRxEVSE)**  \n   - Since the EVSE must correct for its own internal Rx-Path loss (AttnRxEVSE), it adds back this loss value.  \n   - This results in a final reported measured attenuation of **\u221228 dB** per carrier group.\n\n7. **Calculations for Attenuation Measurement for Matching Decision**  \n   - In parallel (shown at the bottom branch of the figure), the PSD at the EV socket (\u221276 dBm/Hz) is compared against a reference PSD mention (\u221250 dBm/Hz) with a reference offset (\u221226 dB).  \n   - The difference is averaged over all carrier groups to get a scalar attenuation value. An example final result shown is **2 dB**.\n\n8. **Report of Measured Attenuation**  \n   - The EVSE finally reports \u201c\u221228 dB\u201d as the measured attenuation per carrier group (after the insertion-loss correction).  \n   - The bottom label notes that the \u201cAttenuation for matching decision is determined by averaging the difference between the reported attenuation values and the reference PSD over all carrier groups.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection of Entities\n\n- **EV (PLC node EV) \u2192 EV Socket**:  \n  Signal originates from the EV\u2019s Green PHY modem at \u221272 dBm/Hz. The \u201cTx-Path AttnTxEV\u201d reduces it by a few dB (e.g., 4 dB).\n\n- **EV Socket \u2192 Charge Cord**:  \n  The EV socket outputs ~\u221276 dBm/Hz. The cord (AttnCord) introduces further loss, giving ~\u221278 dBm/Hz at the EVSE socket.\n\n- **EVSE Socket \u2192 EVSE Modem**:  \n  The signal then passes through the \u201cRx-Path AttnRxEVSE.\u201d By the time it reaches the EVSE modem input, it is at ~\u221281 dBm/Hz.\n\n- **SLAC Measurement Reference**:  \n  The EVSE measures the signal level relative to \u221250 dBm/Hz. The measured result (\u221231 dB) is adjusted upward by the known AttnRxEVSE (3 dB in the example) to give a final reported attenuation of \u221228 dB.\n\n- **Attenuation for Matching Decision**:  \n  A reference of \u221226 dB is used to gauge how much attenuation is really observed relative to the design PSD target. An example final scalar value of 2 dB is shown, though in practice it is averaged over multiple carrier groups.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and Key Takeaways\n\n- All PSD and attenuation values in the diagram (\u221272 dBm/Hz, \u221276 dBm/Hz, \u221278 dBm/Hz, \u221281 dBm/Hz, etc.) are examples for illustration. Real values depend on design, cables, coupling components, and actual measurement setups.  \n- AttnRxEV, AttnTxEV, AttnRxEVSE, AttnTxEVSE, and AttnCord are all insertion-loss factors contributing to the overall reduction of the PLC signal from the EV modem transmitter to the EVSE modem receiver (and vice versa).  \n- The SLAC procedure relies on having a known reference PSD of \u221250 dBm/Hz and requires the EVSE to correct for its own internal losses before reporting attenuation data back to the EV.\n\nThis completes the detailed breakdown of the figure, step-by-step, helping engineers understand precisely how the HomePlug Green PHY communication path is measured and how attenuation values are derived.",

Even though it is not a \u201cflowchart\u201d of processes, each connection is crucial for understanding the measurement setup:\n\n1. **DUT (Device Under Test)**  \n   \u2022 The DUT is shown as a dashed boundary in the illustration. Inside it are:  \n     \u2013 The **PLC node (1)**, tasked with generating or receiving PLC signals.  \n     \u2013 The **EV/EVSE control pilot circuit (2)**, managing standard IEC\u202f61851 pilot functionality.  \n     \u2013 The **data modem (3)**, which converts digital data for PLC.  \n     \u2013 Internal coupling elements: **R_Damp**, **L**, and **C_PLC**, ensuring the signal is properly shaped for pilot-line communication.\n\n2. **Control Pilot Line Out of the DUT (4)**  \n   \u2022 The control pilot line (4) emerges from the DUT. This single conductor carries both the control pilot (low-frequency) signals and the power-line communication (high-frequency) signals.\n\n3. **Entering the Splitter (5)**  \n   \u2022 Immediately after exiting the DUT, the pilot line is attached to a **splitter (5)**.  \n   \u2022 The splitter has two primary outputs:  \n     1. One path continues to the **PLC counterpart station (6)**. This path includes a **5\u202fk\u03a9 resistor** in series, ensuring that the station\u2019s impedance does not unduly affect the PSD measurement.  \n     2. The other path leads to the **50\u202fOhm coax cable**, which feeds into the **spectrum analyser (7)**.\n\n4. **Connection to the PLC Counterpart Station (6)**  \n   \u2022 The **PLC counterpart station (6)** ensures that the DUT remains in active communication mode (at least 20\u202f% of the maximum data rate), as required by the measurement procedure.  \n   \u2022 This communication link is vital; it ensures realistic signal generation from the DUT while measuring.\n\n5. **Measurement Path to the Spectrum Analyser (7)**  \n   \u2022 From the splitter\u2019s second output, a **50\u202f\u03a9 coax cable** carries the high-frequency PLC signal to the **spectrum analyser (7)**.  \n   \u2022 The spectrum analyser\u2019s input impedance is 50\u202f\u03a9, matching the coax cable and system design. This allows direct measurement of the signal\u2019s power over frequencies ranging roughly 1.8\u201330\u202fMHz.\n\n6. **50\u202f\u03a9 System and Additional Coupling Components**  \n   \u2022 Within the measurement path, **Z\u202f=\u202f50\u202f\u03a9** is consistently presented to ensure standard reference conditions.  \n   \u2022 Any **additional components for PLC coupling** (not explicitly shown inside the dashed boundary) are assumed to be 50\u202f\u03a9 compliant, with the system\u2019s overall insertion losses accounted for in measurement calibration.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Purpose and Notes on the Measurement Setup\n\n- **Power Spectral Density (PSD) Measurement:**  \n  The main objective is to measure the PSD of the DUT\u2019s transmitted PLC signal on the pilot line. Engineers collect data via the spectrum analyzer (7) in the 1.8\u201330\u202fMHz band with a 9\u202fkHz resolution bandwidth (per CISPR\u202f16).\n\n- **Isolation and Impedance Control:**  \n  A **5\u202fk\u03a9 resistor** between the PLC counterpart station and the pilot line prevents the station\u2019s input impedance from skewing measurement results. Meanwhile, the system is designed to maintain a **50\u202f\u03a9** environment from the DUT\u2019s pilot line to the spectrum analyzer.\n\n- **Ensuring Active Communication:**  \n  The DUT must actively transmit data (\u2265\u202f20\u202f% of max data rate) to create realistic PLC signals. The **PLC counterpart station (6)** assists by maintaining a \u201clive\u201d communication link.\n\n- **Damping and Filtering Components:**  \n  **R_Damp**, **L**, and **C_PLC** regulate and shape the PLC waveform, ensuring compliance with relevant noise and crossover requirements.\n\n- **Calibration Procedure:**  \n  When conducting the measurement:  \n  1. The spectrum analyzer is set up with proper attenuation to avoid overload.  \n  2. The measurement is recorded across 1.8\u201330\u202fMHz with a 9\u202fkHz RBW (resolution bandwidth).  \n  3. The analyzer\u2019s equivalent noise power bandwidth is factored out to compute the true PSD.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of Key Steps\n\n1. The DUT (including the embedded PLC node and control pilot circuitry) generates the communication signal.  \n2. The control pilot line (4) exits the DUT and enters a splitter (5).  \n3. One output of the splitter connects through a 5\u202fk\u03a9 resistor to the PLC counterpart station (6), keeping the communication session active.  \n4. The other splitter output feeds a 50\u202f\u03a9 coax cable, connecting to a spectrum analyzer (7).  \n5. Engineers measure the signal\u2019s PSD and compare it to standard thresholds defined for V2G communications.\n\nThis setup meets ISO\u202f15118\u20113, Clause\u202fA.11 requirements by ensuring:  \n\u2022 A 50\u202f\u03a9 measurement environment,  \n\u2022 Isolation from the counterpart station,  \n\u2022 Real-time data flow,  \n\u2022 Proper instrumentation bandwidth and calibration.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nFigure\u202fA.12 offers a comprehensive test layout, ensuring consistent and reproducible measurement of PLC signals on the control pilot line for V2G applications. Each component\u2014from the DUT\u2019s internal coupling network down to the spectrum analyzer\u2014contributes to an accurate PSD measurement. By following this schematic, engineers can evaluate whether an EV or EVSE meets the HomePlug Green\u202fPHY requirements specified in ISO\u202f15118\u20113, providing reliable and standardized communication performance over the control pilot line.",

Overall Schematic Overview\n\nThe diagram shows two main sections:\n\n1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) side** (left block)  \n2. **EV (Electric Vehicle) side** (right block)  \n\nThese two blocks are connected via the **control pilot line** and share the same protective earth/ground reference. Within each block, various components provide:\n\n- The generation and measurement of the PWM \u201ccontrol pilot\u201d signal (nominal \u00b112 V at 1 kHz).  \n- The coupling of high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY signals through a dedicated transformer and capacitors.  \n- Protective and filtering elements (resistors, inductors, damping networks, diodes).  \n\nThe high-level purpose is to **inject** and **receive** HomePlug Green PHY communication signals over the control pilot while simultaneously maintaining the standard EVSE\u2013EV PWM control signal (1 kHz) and capturing duty-cycle and amplitude measurements.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Entities (Components) and Their Roles\n\nBelow is a list of the labeled entities from the figure and a short description of each:\n\n1. **Amplitude/state measurement** (labeled \u201c1\u201d)  \n   - Measures the voltage amplitude of the pilot signal, helping determine EV connection state and diagnostic information.\n\n2. **Oscillator \u00b112 V 1 kHz** (labeled \u201c2\u201d)  \n   - The fundamental PWM generator that provides the control pilot signal (\u00b112 V) at 1 kHz on the EVSE side.\n\n3. **PLC chipset** (labeled \u201c3\u201d)  \n   - The HomePlug Green PHY powerline communication module. It couples the data signal onto the control pilot line through a transformer and filter network.\n\n4. **Charge cord Cc < 1 500 pF** (labeled \u201c4\u201d)  \n   - Indicates the total parasitic capacitance of the charging cord connecting the EVSE pilot line to the EV\u2019s inlet. It must be below 1,500 pF.\n\n5. **Dutycycle measurement** (labeled \u201c5\u201d)  \n   - A measurement block that evaluates the PWM duty cycle on the EV side. The EV uses this for determining the available current and state of charge control.\n\n6. **Implementation example with a HomePlug Green PHY coupling transformer** (text at the bottom of the diagram) and **Figure A.13**  \n   - Indicates that this schematic is the official example of how to implement a HomePlug Green PHY coupling onto the control pilot line.\n\n7. **R1, R2, R3**  \n   - Resistors necessary to meet IEC 61851 or ISO 15118 pilot wiring guidelines (e.g., R1 on the EVSE side, R2 & R3 inside the EV circuit). They help set pilot voltages and sense states.\n\n8. **L** (shown on both EVSE and EV as part of an LC filter with \u201cRDamp\u201d)  \n   - An inductor for filtering and shaping the communication and pilot signals. Often used to suppress high-frequency noise.\n\n9. **S2**  \n   - A switching element on the EV side. It may represent enable/disable or grounding states as required by the control pilot standard (IEC 61851).\n\n10. **RDamp**  \n    - A damping resistor (220\u202f\u03a9 in the example) placed in series with the inductor L. It helps control or damp resonances in the pilot line.\n\n11. **Cs**  \n    - A capacitor on the EVSE side that, together with R1 and other passive components, forms part of the pilot shaping and filtering network.\n\n12. **CM**  \n    - A small coupling capacitor (100\u202fpF in the example) used for noise filtering or common-mode coupling.\n\n13. **RM**  \n    - A resistor in the megaohm-to-kilohm range (shown as 10\u202fk\u03a9 in the example). Often used to form a referencing path for measuring pilot or for protection.\n\n14. **2\u00d7\u202fCPLC**  \n    - Two coupling capacitors (each about 1.35\u202fnF in the example) that convey the high-frequency communication signals from the PLC chipset transformer out to, or in from, the pilot line\u2014while blocking the low-frequency (1\u202fkHz) PWM from interfering directly with the PLC chipset.\n\n15. **CV**  \n    - Another capacitor (labeled \u201c[IEC-1]\u201d in the example table) on the EV side for pilot signal conditioning or filtering.\n\n16. **D**  \n    - A diode in the EV circuit. It can be for polarity protection or controlling certain pilot states (e.g., releasing pilot line if there is an error).\n\n17. **EVSE**  \n    - The electric vehicle supply equipment block containing the control pilot generation, measurement, and the PLC modem coupling network (left-hand block).\n\n18. **EV**  \n    - The electric vehicle block containing the pilot detection circuit, duty cycle measurement, and the complementary PLC modem coupling (right-hand block).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Signal Paths and Connections\n\nAlthough not a classic \u201cflowchart,\u201d the diagram displays how signals flow between the EVSE and EV via the pilot line. The main paths are:\n\n1. **Pilot PWM Path (Low-Frequency: 1\u202fkHz)**  \n   - On the **EVSE side**, the \u00b112\u202fV, 1\u202fkHz oscillator (2) injects the control pilot signal.  \n   - The pilot amplitude is monitored by the **amplitude/state measurement** (1) in the EVSE to detect EV presence and state transitions.  \n   - On the **EV side**, the duty-cycle measurement (5) monitors the arriving PWM for the pilot signal\u2019s high/low levels. The EV can switch S2 or adjust internal connections to signal different EV states (e.g., charging, ventilation required, etc.).  \n   - **R1, R2, R3, Cs, CV, CM, and RM** adjust or sense the pilot line level and ensure pilot compliance to IEC 61851-1.\n\n2. **HomePlug Green PHY Data Path (High-Frequency: ~1.8\u202fMHz\u201330\u202fMHz)**  \n   - **PLC chipset (3)** on the EVSE side drives/receives high-frequency signals through a **coupling transformer** and the pair of capacitors **(2\u00d7\u202fCPLC)**.  \n   - The communication signals combine with the pilot line through these coupling capacitors but do not substantially affect the 1\u202fkHz pilot thanks to filtering by the inductor **L**, resistors **RDamp**, and other high-frequency\u2013blocking elements.  \n   - At the **EV side**, the high-frequency PLC signal also couples via **2\u00d7\u202fCPLC** and a similar **transformer** arrangement.  \n   - **L** (the inductor) and **RDamp** components on both sides help prevent large resonance or undesired signal reflection.  \n   - The diode **D** can protect the EV from any reversed or high-voltage events.  \n\n3. **Charge Cord Consideration**  \n   - The **charge cord Cc <\u202f1\u202f500\u202fpF** (4) is shown as the cable parasitic capacitance. Keeping this capacitance low is necessary to preserve signal integrity for both the pilot PWM and high-frequency PLC communication.\n\n4. **Ground/Earth Reference**  \n   - Both EVSE and EV are referenced to a common ground for safety and measurement consistency.  \n   - The standard requires that the pilot line operate with known references for amplitude measurement and duty cycle detection.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Step-by-Step Function (Interpretation)\n\nTo interpret this schematic in a stepwise \u201cflow,\u201d consider the main functionality:\n\n1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  \n   a. The oscillator (2) outputs a \u00b112\u202fV, 1\u202fkHz PWM.  \n   b. This signal passes through R1, Cs, and other pilot-conditioning components.  \n   c. The **amplitude/state measurement** (1) on the EVSE side observes the pilot voltage amplitude to detect EV presence.  \n\n2. **Pilot Signal Transmission via Control Pilot**  \n   a. The pilot line travels through the charge cord.  \n   b. **2\u00d7\u202fCPLC** capacitors on each side couple the broadband PLC signals but appear high-impedance at low frequency (1\u202fkHz), so the pilot is only mildly affected.  \n   c. The pilot line arrives at the EV\u2019s circuit with R2, R3, etc., that set or detect the pilot level.  \n\n3. **Pilot Signal Detection (EV side)**  \n   a. The duty cycle measurement (5) block measures the incoming PWM signal.  \n   b. S2 and the diode (D) can switch states according to standard charging protocols (e.g., controlling whether the EV is ready for charging, demands ventilation, etc.).  \n\n4. **HomePlug Green PHY Communication**  \n   a. The EVSE\u2019s PLC chipset (3) injects high-frequency signals through a coupling transformer and **2\u00d7\u202fCPLC**.  \n   b. The EV\u2019s PLC circuitry also couples through an identical transformer and capacitor arrangement.  \n   c. Inductor (L) and RDamp on both sides help shape or attenuate high-frequency noise.  \n   d. This ensures data can flow between EVSE and EV over the same pilot line used for PWM.  \n\nBy combining these steps, the system achieves **both** standard pilot control (per IEC\u202f61851-1) **and** high-frequency data communication (per ISO\u202f15118 / HomePlug Green PHY).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Additional Notes for Engineers\n\n- **Component Values**:  \n  Table\u202fA.12 of the standard gives typical component values (e.g., L\u202f=\u202f220\u202f\u00b5H, RDamp\u202f=\u202f220\u202f\u03a9, CPLC\u202f=\u202f1.35\u202fnF, etc.). Actual values depend on the specific PLC chipset design and compliance with ISO\u202f15118-3 and IEC\u202f61851.  \n\n- **50\u202f\u03a9 Considerations**:  \n  Many measurement recommendations in ISO\u202f15118-3 specify a 50\u202f\u03a9 environment (e.g., for spectrum analyzers, for measuring PSD). The design must ensure consistent 50\u202f\u03a9 terminations and minimal insertion loss in the PLC frequency range.\n\n- **PWM Integrity**:  \n  The pilot\u2019s \u00b112\u202fV amplitude and shape must not be distorted beyond specification. This includes ensuring the high-frequency coupling doesn\u2019t degrade the 1\u202fkHz pilot signal or the EV\u2019s ability to measure duty cycle accurately.\n\n- **Safety**:  \n  Elements like the diode (D) and the resistor networks protect against transient conditions and ensure no unsafe voltages appear on the pilot line.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary\n\nFigure\u202fA.13 illustrates a complete example of how to **inject HomePlug Green PHY signals** onto the **control pilot** between EVSE and EV, while still respecting the **IEC\u202f61851** pilot requirements (\u00b112\u202fV at 1\u202fkHz) and enabling **iso15118** high-level communication. Each component shown is carefully chosen to filter, protect, or measure signals at both low (1\u202fkHz pilot) and high (1.8\u201330\u202fMHz) frequencies, ensuring proper broadband communication and standard-compliant PWM pilot functionality.",

Entities Overview\n\nThis figure aligns the lower layers (Physical and Data Link) from ISO 15118-3 with the classic seven-layer **OSI reference model**. The main entities (or \u201cblocks\u201d) and interfaces are:\n\n1. **OSI Reference Model Layers**  \n   - Application  \n   - Presentation  \n   - Session  \n   - Transport  \n   - Network  \n   - Data Link  \n   - Physical  \n\n2. **Higher Layers**  \n   - These represent the OSI layers above the Data Link layer (i.e., Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).

Hierarchical Layout and Relationships\n\nAlthough the figure does not represent a **sequential** flow like a typical flowchart, it shows *which OSI layers correspond to which G3-PLC sublayers and interfaces*. Below is a top-to-bottom description:\n\n1. **Higher Layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network)**  \n   - These top layers of the OSI stack are collectively shown as \u201cHigher layers\u201d in the G3-PLC architecture diagram. They rely on the data link and physical layers for actual data transmission over the pilot line.\n\n2. **Data Link Layer**  \n   - In the classic OSI model, the Data Link layer is a single block. In the G3-PLC context, it is subdivided further into:  \n     - **6LoWPAN Adaptation Sublayer**  \n       - Bridges IPv6 (network layer) and the underlying MAC.  \n       - Provides fragmentation, compression, and adaptation for low-bandwidth links.  \n     - **MAC Layer**  \n       - Implements media access control (channel access methods, scheduling, addressing).  \n       - Provides data service (MCPS-SAP) and management service (MLME-SAP).\n\n3. **Service Access Points (SAPs) at the Data Link Layer**  \n   - **Data link Data SAP**  \n     - Provides a data interface for higher layers to send and receive frames.  \n   - **Data link Control SAP**  \n     - Offers link status and control information (e.g., error conditions, link up/down events).\n   - **MCPS-SAP** (MAC Common Part)  \n     - The SAP for data exchange between the MAC and next sublayer (6LoWPAN or higher).  \n   - **MLME-SAP** (MAC Management)  \n     - The SAP for management commands/notifications (e.g., initialization, configuration).\n\n4. **Physical Layer**  \n   - The lowest OSI layer, handling signal transmission/reception on the pilot line.  \n   - Provides raw bit-level data services and management functionalities.  \n   - **PD-SAP** (Physical Data)  \n     - The SAP for exchanging actual data bits with the MAC layer.  \n   - **PLME-SAP** (Physical Layer Management)  \n     - The SAP for controlling physical layer parameters (e.g., modulation schemes, frequency allocation).\n\n5. **Signal Coupling**  \n   - Shows how the physical layer interfaces with the cable, ensuring the PLC signal is superimposed on or extracted from the pilot line.\n\n6. **Communication Media**  \n   - The physical cable assembly (i.e., control pilot line) that carries the PLC signal to and from the EV (vehicle) and the charging station.\n\n7. **Pilot Line**  \n   - Indicates the actual line or conductor used for carrying the pilot signal, which also supports G3-PLC communication under ISO 15118.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation and Connection of the Entities\n\n1. **OSI Layers \u2192 Data Link & Physical Layers**  \n   - The top four OSI layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport) are not explicitly expanded in the G3-PLC architecture, but they logically pass data down through the Network layer.  \n   - The Network layer interacts with the **6LoWPAN Adaptation Sublayer**, which in turn passes data to/from the MAC layer.\n\n2. **Data Link Layer \u2192 MAC Layer**  \n   - The **6LoWPAN Adaptation Sublayer** and MAC layer together form the Data Link layer in the G3-PLC context.  \n   - **MCPS-SAP** (at the MAC layer boundary) is used for data traffic, while **MLME-SAP** is used for MAC management.\n\n3. **MAC Layer \u2192 Physical Layer**  \n   - Data frames and management commands move between the MAC (@ MCPS-SAP/MLME-SAP) and the Physical layer (@ PD-SAP/PLME-SAP) as data or control signals.  \n   - The MAC decides how and when to access the shared PLC medium, while the Physical layer actually transmits or receives the encoded signal.\n\n4. **Physical Layer \u2192 Signal Coupling \u2192 Communication Media**  \n   - The Physical layer\u2019s output is coupled (via \u201cSignal coupling\u201d) onto the **Pilot line**.  \n   - **Communication media** is the actual cable, ensuring the signal travels between EV and charging station.\n\n5. **Covered by G3 Specification**  \n   - All shaded areas (Data Link and Physical layers, along with their sublayers and SAP interfaces) are under the scope of G3-PLC technology, as indicated by the \u201ccovered by G3 specification\u201d label.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Additional Notes\n\n- **Data Link Control SAP**: Exposes link status and manages error handling for upper layers.  \n- **Physical Layer**: Implements the lowest-level signaling, enabling robust data exchange in the presence of noise/interference on the pilot line.  \n- **Signal Coupling**: Defined in the document section B.9 to describe how the G3-PLC signal is added to or extracted from the pilot line.  \n- **Communication Media**: The pilot line within the charging cable assembly is the medium for all PLC communication.  \n- **Annex B in ISO 15118-3**: Explains how G3-PLC maps to the Vehicle-to-Grid communication interface, describing these sublayers in detail.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n**Figure B.1** illustrates how G3-PLC\u2019s MAC and Physical layers fit within the OSI model for ISO 15118\u2019s Vehicle-to-Grid communication. Each service access point (SAP) defines a clear interface for data or management functionalities moving between sublayers. The final outcome is a coherent architecture allowing higher-level protocols (e.g., for EV charging, billing, and network communication) to transmit data over a robust, power-line-based physical medium.",

Step-by-Step Signal/Circuit Path Description\n\nBecause this diagram is a coupling circuit rather than a traditional directional \u201cflow chart,\u201d the best way to describe its \u201cflow\u201d is to trace how a G3-PLC signal travels between the modems:\n\n1. **AC Pilot Supply and Pilot Reference (Left Most Side)**  \n   - A pilot signal or supply is connected through **R1 (1 k\u03a9)**.  \n   - **C1 (300 pF)** goes from the pilot conductor to ground (node \u201c0\u201d) for noise filtering.  \n\n2. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EVSE Side (Lx1 & Rx1)**  \n   - After leaving R1/C1, the pilot line passes through **Lx1 (1 000 \u00b5H)** in series with **Rx1 (680 \u03a9)**.  \n   - These form the mandatory high-frequency blocking or \u201cchoke\u201d to keep the pilot circuit from shunting all high-frequency energy to ground.\n\n3. **Coupling to EVSE Modem (Block \u201c1\u201d)**  \n   - The pilot line node (between Lx1/Rx1 and T2/T7) goes to two coupling capacitors feeding the EVSE modem:  \n     - **Cx3 (< 500 pF)** \u2192 Possibly connected toward the modem **In** pin, with resistor **Rx5 (> 10 k\u03a9)** referencing input impedance to ground.  \n     - **Cx1 (500 pF)** \u2192 Possibly connected toward the modem **Out** pin, with resistor **Rx3 (1 k\u03a9)** as the modem\u2019s internal source resistor for the HF signal.  \n   - These capacitors pass the high-frequency G3-PLC signals but block low-frequency or DC pilot currents.\n\n4. **Cable Assembly and Center Coupling (T2 and T7)**  \n   - **T2** is the physical cable from EVSE to EV, carrying the pilot conductor (and possibly other conductors).  \n   - **T7** is an in-line coupling element or test point. The standard simply shows T7 in the path, which might be used for measurement or for additional filtering.\n\n5. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EV Side (Lx2 & Rx2)**  \n   - On the vehicle side, the pilot conductor is again routed through another set of inductor and resistor: **Lx2 (1 000 \u00b5H)** and **Rx2 (680 \u03a9)**.  \n   - As on the EVSE side, Lx2 and Rx2 ensure that the EV\u2019s internal pilot circuitry does not excessively load or short out the PLC signal.\n\n6. **EV Standard Pilot Connection (C2b, R2, R3, S1)**  \n   - The figure shows some typical pilot-circuit resistors **R2 (2.7 k\u03a9)**, **R3 (1.3 k\u03a9)**, and switch **S1**. These are part of the standard IEC 61851-1 pilot function for controlling and detecting EV presence or charging states.  \n   - A capacitor **C2b (1 n? )** may also appear, used for smoothing or filtering within the EV\u2019s pilot logic.  \n\n7. **Coupling to EV Modem (Block \u201c2\u201d)**  \n   - Similar to the EVSE side, the EV modem connects to the pilot line through coupling capacitors and limiting resistors:  \n     - **Cx2 (500 pF)** is the main coupling capacitor for the high-frequency transmit/receive path.  \n     - **Rx4 (1 k\u03a9)** is the internal source/limiting resistor.  \n     - **Cx4 (< 500 pF)** could be the receive filter capacitor.  \n     - **Rx6 (> 10 k\u03a9)** is again an optional high-value input impedance resistor to ground.  \n\n8. **Signal Path for G3-PLC**  \n   - In essence, the G3-PLC signal travels from the EVSE modem (left block) \u2192 coupling capacitors (Cx1/Cx3) \u2192 pilot line through Lx1 + Rx1 \u2192 T2/T7 \u2192 Lx2 + Rx2 \u2192 coupling capacitors (Cx2/Cx4) \u2192 EV modem (right block).  \n   - The mandatory values of Lx1, Lx2 (each 1 000 \u00b5H), Rx1, Rx2 (each 680 \u03a9), and Cx1, Cx2 (each 500 pF) are specified to ensure consistent attenuation and adequate coupling across a wide frequency range, while also meeting EMC requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Connections and Relationships\n\n- **Pilot Wire Core**: The pilot wire is the main conductor bridging EVSE and EV. It carries both the standard PWM pilot signal (per IEC 61851-1) and now the superimposed high-frequency G3-PLC signals.\n- **High-Frequency Isolation**:  \n  - Lx1, Rx1, Lx2, Rx2 form the series choke and damping sections.  \n  - These prevent the pilot line\u2019s normal low-frequency control signal from interfering with G3-PLC, and vice versa.\n- **Coupling Capacitors**:  \n  - Cx1, Cx2 provide the primary path for injecting/extracting high-frequency signals to/from the pilot line.  \n  - Cx3, Cx4 are secondary capacitors for filtering or for the input side of the modem.\n- **Resistive Networks**:  \n  - Rx3, Rx4 are the output resistors from the modem perspective (limiting voltage amplitude).  \n  - Rx5, Rx6 are optional high-value input resistors to ground or to the reference inside the modem, allowing minimal loading.  \n- **Standard Pilot Components**:  \n  - R1, C1, R2, R3, and S1 are from IEC 61851-1 pilot circuit definition, ensuring safe operation and standardized detection of charge states. They are \u201cinformational\u201d in this figure but included so that engineers see the complete interplay between pilot function and PLC signals.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Additional Notes from the Standard\n\n1. **Signal Level Requirements**  \n   - Per ISO 15118-3 and IEEE 1901.2 references, the PLC signal on the pilot wire is limited to 0.5 V RMS maximum (to avoid interference with pilot PWM) and at least 0.2 V RMS to ensure reliable communication.\n\n2. **Mandatory Coupling Values**  \n   - Inductors:  \n     - Lx1, Lx2 = 1 000 \u00b5H (each)  \n   - Resistors:  \n     - Rx1, Rx2 \u2248 680 \u03a9 (each)  \n     - Rx3, Rx4 \u2248 1 k\u03a9 (internal source)  \n     - Rx5, Rx6 > 10 k\u03a9 (optional input)  \n   - Capacitors:  \n     - Cx1, Cx2 = 500 pF  \n     - Cx3, Cx4 < 500 pF (exact value can vary)  \n\n3. **EMC Compliance**  \n   - Clause B.10 in ISO 15118-3 references EMC requirements from IEEE 1901.2. Additional filtering or decoupling elements can be added to ensure no more than 0.5 V RMS on the pilot-based PWM signal.\n\n4. **Cable Assembly (T2)**  \n   - T2 denotes the physical link between EVSE and EV. The standard clarifies that cable/detachable connectors must accommodate the pilot line for both the low-frequency PWM and the high-frequency G3-PLC signals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical Engineering Takeaways\n\n1. **Must-Have Components**:  \n   - Ensure the presence of inductors (Lx1, Lx2) and the coupling capacitors (Cx1, Cx2) per the mandatory values if implementing G3 technology on the pilot line.  \n2. **In-Modem Resistance**:  \n   - The 1 k\u03a9 resistors (Rx3, Rx4) help maintain consistent pilot-wire voltage amplitude for the G3 signals.  \n3. **EMC & Filtering**:  \n   - Additional filtering on power lines (e.g., at the EVSE side) might be necessary in noisy environments.  \n4. **Pilot Circuit**:  \n   - R1, R2, R3, C1, and S1 remain part of basic pilot architecture per IEC 61851-1:2010 Annex A.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\nFigure B.2 shows how a G3-PLC modem on both the EVSE (block \u201c1\u201d) and the EV (block \u201c2\u201d) couples their high-frequency communication signals onto the same pilot wire used for the standard IEC 61851-1 charging control. Key components\u2014**Lx1, Lx2, Rx1, Rx2, Cx1, Cx2**\u2014protect the pilot circuit from unwanted loading and allow reliable PLC signal transmission. The resistor-capacitor networks and optional additional filters ensure the PLC signal stays within required amplitude limits (0.2\u20130.5 V RMS) while still leaving the pilot function intact.\n\nEngineers referencing this figure should pay special attention to the mandatory component values and overall pilot-circuit layout, verifying that each device (EVSE and EV) implements these coupling elements as specified by ISO 15118-3, Annex B, and IEEE 1901.2 to ensure interoperability and EMC compliance."
