However, it omits substantial detail found in the Expected Output: lacks thorough explanation of the coupling techniques (transformer, capacitive network, filters), specific protocol stack layers and their primitives (e.g., Control SAP, ETH SAP), detailed network formation (CCo, NMK/NID, AVLN), precise SLAC message names and ATTEN_PROFILE, adjustable power and EMC mechanisms, and specific standardization/testing references like Release 1.1.1, IEC 61851-1, and V2G3-A11-0x.

However, it omits critical detail from the Expected Output, such as specific steps (e.g., CM_MNBC_SOUND_IND, matching handshake with CM_SLAC_MATCH_REQ/CNF, joining the HPGP network, and raw Ethernet/MME transport), does not explicitly note the Secure Network Membership Key (NMK) exchange, and lacks certain technical steps (e.g., timers, validation as optional), which are key for a full response per the evaluation steps."

However, some specific expected details are omitted: identifiers like NMK are not named; explicit reference to SLAC/MME parameter exchange and messages like CM_SLAC_MATCH is missing; clearing NMK on leave and reference to specific timers (e.g. TP_match_leave) are not described.

However, it omits several important implementation details mentioned in Expected Output, such as specific examples of EIM tokens (RFID, apps), precise protocol/component interactions (SECC, SECC Tester, SLAC, V2G5-033/-034 specifics), and conformance testing references.

However, it omits the specification that APPLICATION_TYPE and SECURITY_TYPE must be set to 0x00 for the main use case, does not mention the hex code 0x6064, or the exact process around TP_EV_SLAC_init and EV's response wait timer. It also lacks explicit mention of specific additional SLAC parameters like slot timing or M-Sound symbols and omits details about the unicast nature and structure of CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF.

However, it omits key detail: it does not specify the message direction (sent by EV), C_EV_start_atten_char_inds parameter, batch message interval (TP_EV_batch_msg_interval), granular test case behaviors, and downstream actions like EVSE sending M-SOUND bursts or the EV\u2019s low-layer responses.

Minor omissions include lack of explicit mention that APPLICATION_TYPE and SECURITY_TYPE are both fixed to 0x00, no clear ordering that sending occurs after CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, missing reference to the EV not responding to the message, and absence of concrete test-case examples (like TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_ATTENUATIONCHARACTERIZATION_001).

However, it omits or under-emphasizes several details from the expected output: it does not specify that CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND is sent specifically from the EV to the EVSE, it lacks mention of metadata contents like timestamps or sequence counters, and it leaves out the broader matching session lifecycle (e.g., initiation via CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, transition after matching).

However, several important details are omitted: it does not specify that CM_VALIDATE.CNF is always sent by the EVSE/SECC in response to the EV, misses mention of SLAC and specific timer names (e.g., TT_match_response), lacks information on resending logic for repeated REQ with timer=0, and omits references to protocol conformance and test case requirements noted in the expected output."
