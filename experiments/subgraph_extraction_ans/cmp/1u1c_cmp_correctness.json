        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "They match overall roles (MTC as test controller with pt_SLAC_Port, PTC as PWM monitor for EIM), referencing the Input question about differences and aligning with the Expected Output hierarchy and responsibilities. Missing details on specific SLAC messages (CmValidate, etc.) that the Expected Output lists, but no factual contradictions."
