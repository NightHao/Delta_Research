However, it omits or glosses over specific details emphasized in the expected output: the layering approach (physical, data link, network/transport, and application), back-end/grid integration (e.g., OCPP, aggregator roles), explicit message/transition sequences like B1/B2 and BCB toggling, PLC specifics (ISO 15118-3 vs -4), and does not show the explicit step-by-step session process outlined. Some protocol and test case specifics (like TC_\u2026_PLCLinkStatus vs only naming TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_CMVALIDATE) are missing, and physical layer hardware details (meter, on-board charger, connector standards) are not described. Thus, while detailed, it lacks several critical specificities present in expected output."

However, it omits specific technical details present in the expected output, such as the use and function of the Network Membership Key (NMK), SLAC/MME protocol specifics, timer names like TP_match_leave, and some explicit statements about resetting network parameters on leave. These omissions of exact mechanisms and terminology merit a score reduction."

However, it omits specifics like NetID/key management, SLAC/LLDP message use, the exact assignment of roles to EVSE vs. EV, precise enforcement of CCo on EVSE only, the APCM_SET_CCo.REQ primitive, and makes general references instead of naming protocols and details directly, leading to penalization for omission."

However, some specific details are omitted, such as explicit mention of mapping to specific tables (Table 29 and Table 27), identification of 'X'-marked requirements, grouping by use case/domain, and the two-step interpretation/execution process with roles of adaptors and interfaces, resulting in a minor loss of granularity."

However, some key details are omitted or generalized: there is no explicit mention of APPLICATION_TYPE or SECURITY_TYPE fields (only broader field types given), it does not specify the cnt field logic (decrementing per message), and omits the point that the EV's lower layer must not respond to the message (V2G3-A06-05).

However, it omits some precise detail about message direction (EVSE to EV, not bidirectional), the triggering event (sent after CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), conformance test cases by name, the exact function of each principal field (like 0x00 values), use of timers (TT_EV_atten_results), and the fact that the EV must compute the attenuation mean.
