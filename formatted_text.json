    "text": "\"Here is the difference between the Main Test Component (MTC) and the Parallel Test Component (PTC) without using a table, preserving all important details:\n\nIn a typical testing framework for electric vehicle charging (e.g., using IEC 61851-1 or ISO 15118–3 methods), you will see Main Test Components (MTC) and Parallel Test Components (PTC) working together. While both are important, they serve distinct roles:\n\n1. Main Test Component (MTC):\n• Primary or Central Controller: The MTC is the top-level or “main” element in the test configuration. It creates and coordinates any parallel components, orchestrates the overall test flow, and determines final test results (i.e., verdicts).\n• Test Logic and Verdict Assignment: The MTC executes the bulk of the test logic (test case steps, conditions, sequences) in TTCN‑3 or whichever testing notation you are using. It collects relevant outcomes and assigns the final pass/fail verdict based on conditions discovered throughout the test.\n• Manages Data Link Processing and Higher-Level Control: The MTC manages more complex tasks such as data link status control, advanced message handling, and overall state transitions. For example, it may reduce or adjust signal levels based on certain messages, handle EIM (External Identification Means) authorization logic, or instruct the SUT (System Under Test) to proceed through certain states.\n• Could Be EVCC_Tester or SECC_Tester: Depending on the type of System Under Test, the MTC might be the EVCC_Tester (if the SUT is an EVCC) or the SECC_Tester (if the SUT is an SECC).\n\n2. Parallel Test Component (PTC):\n• Supplementary or Monitoring Role: The PTC works in parallel with the MTC, focusing on observing or monitoring certain aspects of the charging communication—especially signals that require continuous observation.\n• Signal and State Monitoring: Commonly, in IEC 61851–1 tests, the PTC continuously checks the PWM line (control pilot) for duty cycle, state changes, and other parameters. The PTC can also track external states such as EIM authorization success or failure, then report these back to the MTC.\n• Less Complex Control Logic: Typically, the PTC does not manage overall test flow or produce final test verdicts. Rather, it feeds crucial updates to the MTC (for example, reporting a change in PWM state or notifying about successful EIM authorization). The MTC then decides how the test sequence proceeds or how to evaluate the SUT’s behavior based on this information.\n• Created or Driven by the MTC: The MTC spawns the PTC to run in the background. While the MTC executes the main test scenario, the PTC keeps watch on signals or states, providing continuous feedback.\n\nKey Differences in Practice (rewritten as descriptive points):\n• Role: The MTC is the primary test controller that orchestrates sequences and sets verdicts, whereas the PTC is secondary and focused on monitoring signals or states in parallel.\n• Responsibility: The MTC executes main test logic (test steps, sequences, and configuration), while the PTC continuously checks or logs real-time signals like PWM duty cycle or EIM status.\n• Verdict Assignment: The MTC computes and assigns pass/fail verdicts, whereas the PTC merely supplies data back to the MTC without determining the final verdict.\n• Creation and Ownership: The MTC is created once as the main driver of the test environment, whereas the PTC is spawned and controlled by the MTC to track specific states or signals in parallel.\n• Scope of Control: The MTC can manage advanced link status and instruct the SUT to transition states, whereas the PTC focuses on simpler tasks like verifying PWM signals, monitoring duty cycles, or checking EIM authorization.\n\nSummary:\nThe Main Test Component (MTC) is the primary controlling entity that orchestrates tests, executes logic, interacts deeply with the System Under Test, and assigns the overall outcome. Meanwhile, the Parallel Test Component (PTC) is a secondary or helper component that runs alongside the MTC, handling continuous observation tasks (for example, watching the PWM signal or EIM authorization) and reporting its findings to the MTC. By working together, both components ensure a thorough and accurate test coverage for electric vehicle charging protocols.\""
