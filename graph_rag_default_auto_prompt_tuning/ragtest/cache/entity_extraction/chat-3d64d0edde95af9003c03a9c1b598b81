communication, uses the bidirectional \nsignalling according to [IEC-1], indicating EV related information through control pilot states and EVSE \nrelated information through the duty cycle of the control pilot signal.\n6.2.2\t\nHigh-level communication\n[V2G3-M06-02]\nThe HLC shall be used in addition to the basic signalling in order to enable a bidi-\nrectional communication and offer additional features.\nThe sequence of the data exchange within the HLC-based charging session is done in accordance with \nthe [ISO-2] communication protocol.\nIt can be split into three periods as follows:\n—\t data link setup;\n—\t V2G setup;\n—\t V2G charging loop.\nNOTE\t\nThe detailed descriptions are given in [ISO-2].\n﻿\n© ISO 2015 – All rights reserved\b\n7\nLicensed to National Tsing

15118-3:2015(E)\n[V2G3-M06-03]\nDuring the V2G charging loop, the PWM duty cycle shall not change due to dynam-\nically changed grid information. Those dynamically changed grid limitations shall \nbe provided through the high-level communication messages.\nIn case basic charging is used as back-up of HLC-C (e.g. when HLC-C has failed), the duty cycle is allowed \nto change due to dynamically changed grid information, according [IEC-1] requirements.\n6.3 Identification requirements\nThe initialization phase depends on whether identification “ID from EV” or EIM is required, as described \nin [ISO-1], use-cases D1, D2, D3, and D4.\n[V2G3-M06-04]\nWhen authorization (payment) is required for charging, the EVSE shall offer PnC \n(ID from EV) or EIM means.\nAny payment included in a package (parking fee, in a flat rate, etc.) is considered as “No ID required” \nsince the energy is paid for by means totally independent of the EVSE.\nNOTE 1\t\nThe need for authentication can be externally triggered.\nNOTE 2\t\nThe “ID required” covers only the ID for operating purposes and does not cover all the identification \nlinked to the “security” as described in the [ISO-2].\nNOTE 3\t\nThe feature PnC is called “ID from EV”, using the message set of [ISO-2].\nNOTE 4\t\nAt a publicly accessible EVSE with only “ID from EV”, there might be a fallback solution to allow any EV \nto be able to charge.\nIf the duty cycle is set to 5 % and PnC is intended to be used, the EVCC may launch an “ID recognition” \nfrom the EV (Use-case D1 and D2 of [ISO-1]). According to the EV’s answer, the SECC may decide to allow \nthe charge or not.\n6.4\t System requirements\nIn the following subclauses, the abbreviations concerning the control pilot states (eg X1, X2, B1, B2, etc.), \nare described in [IEC-3].\n6.4.1\t\nOverview\nThis Clause defines the requirements on the triggering of the EVSE and the EV immediately after the \nplug-in of the cable assembly. It includes the specifications of sequences, when and how the contract ID \nis recognized, when to launch the matching process (at the MAC level), and how to decide to use basic \ncharging or high-level communication charging.\n6.4.2\t\nEVSE\n6.4.2.1\t\nControl pilot requirements\nEach EVSE outlet has its own dedicated pilot function controller.\nThe trigger and timing relations between basic signalling and HLC connection setup are described in Clause 7.\nFor implementation and synchronization between [IEC-1] and [ISO-3], please refer to [ISO-2] 8.7.4.\nNOTE 1\t\nIf a nominal duty cycle is set, it is recommended to keep it as the maximum current capacity of the \ncharging station and let the high-level communication messages dynamically adjust the available max current.\n﻿\n8\b\n© ISO 2015 – All rights reserved\nLicensed to National Tsing Hua University / Yi-Shin Chen (yishin@gmail.com) \nISO Store Order: OP-720751 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-10-04 \nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n﻿\nISO 15118-3:2015(E)\n[V2G3-M06-05]\nIn case no communication could be established with a 5 % control pilot duty cycle \n(matching process not started), if the EVSE wants to switch to a nominal duty cycle, \nthen the change from 5 % to a nominal duty cycle shall be done with a specific \nsequence B2 or C2 (5 %) -> E or F -> B2 (nominal value) to allow backward compati-\nbility.
