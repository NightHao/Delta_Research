side.\nAfter the signal strength measurement, the EV can decide on the basis of the results to request the \nEVSE for an additional validation process. As soon as the EVSE is ready to detect the control pilot line, \nthe EV sends a random timer value TP_EV_vald_toggle to the EVSE. After sending the message, the EV \nswitches the control pilot state in the sequence B-C-B. This switching sequence is called BCB-Toggle in \nthe following.\nAccording to the EVSE architecture, the EVSE can answer to the request by the following certain states.\n—\t “Not Required” state: This is just a recommendation from the EVSE, the EV decides either to follow \nthe EVSE recommendation and to skip the validation process or to continue the process and to \nperform the validation process.\n—\t “Failure” state: This is an indication from the EVSE that it does not support the validation process. \nThe EV decides to either terminate the matching process with the current EVSE and go on with the \nnext EVSE or to skip the validation process with the current EVSE.\n—\t “Ready” state: This is an indication from the EVSE that it does support the validation process and is \nready to continue the validation process.\nIn case of a performed validation process, the EV performs multiple BCB-Toggles during the time TP_EV_\nvald_toggle. The number of BCB-Toggles (C_EV_vald_nb_toggles) is chosen randomly in the available time.\nAt the end of the timer, the EVSE sends a frame with the number of BCB-Toggles seen on the Control Pilot \nline and waits for the decision value.\n﻿\n© ISO 2015 – All rights reserved\b\n25\nLicensed to National Tsing Hua University / Yi-Shin Chen (yishin@gmail.com) \nISO Store Order: OP-720751 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-10-04 \nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n﻿\nISO 15118-3:2015(E)\nIf supported, and in order to perform the validation process, EVs and EVSEs have to implement a method \nto validate the EV-EVSE connection based on the signal sequence “EV signal to the EVSE” defined in \n[IEC-1], Annex A.\nCP state C \nCP state B \nTP_EV_vald_toggle\nTP_EV_vald_\nstate_duration\nTP_EV_vald_\nstate_duration\nTP_EV_vald_\nstate_duration\nTP_EV_vald_\nstate_duration\nTP_EV_vald_\nstate_duration\n1st toggle\n2nd toggle\ninital\nB-state\n[V2G3-M09-06]\nIn accordance with [IEC-1], the EV shall support the sequence of “BCB-Toggle” \ndefined in Figure 12.\nFigure 12 — Example of BCB-Toggle sequence with C_EV_vald_nb_toggles = 2 and active oscillator\n[V2G3-M09-07]\nIf the EV status is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”, the EV shall start the validation \nprocess.
