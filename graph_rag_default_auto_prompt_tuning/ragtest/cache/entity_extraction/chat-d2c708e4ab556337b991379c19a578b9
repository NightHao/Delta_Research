The work of preparing International Standards is normally \ncarried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a \ntechnical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. \nInternational organizations, governmental and non‐governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in \nthe work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all \nmatters of electrotechnical standardization. \nThe procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are \ndescribed in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the \ndifferent types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the \neditorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives). \nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of \npatent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of \nany patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or \non the ISO list of patent declarations received (see www.iso.org/patents). \nAny trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of users and does not \nconstitute an endorsement. \nFor an explanation on the voluntary nature of standards, the meaning of ISO specific terms and \nexpressions related to conformity assessment, as well as information about ISO's adherence to the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) principles in the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) see the following \nURL: www.iso.org/iso/foreword.html \nThis document was prepared jointly by Technical Committee ISO/TC 22, Road vehicles, Subcommittee \nSC 31, Data communication, and Technical Committee IEC/TC 69, Electric road vehicles and electric \nindustrial trucks. The draft was circulated for voting to the national bodies of both ISO and IEC.  \nA list of all parts in the ISO 15118 series can be found on the ISO website. \nThis corrected version of ISO 18541‐6:2018 incorporates the following corrections: \n— the foreword has been revised to indicate joint development with IEC/TC 69, Electric road \nvehicles and electric industrial trucks. \nLicensed to National Tsing Hua University / Yi-Shin Chen (yishin@gmail.com) \nISO Store Order: OP-720751 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-10-04 \nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\nISO 15118-5:2018(E) \nviii \n© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved \nIntroduction \nThe first two parts of ISO 15118 describe the use cases and the technical specification of the Vehicle‐to‐\nGrid Communication Interface which is intended for the optimized use of energy resources so that \nelectric road vehicles can recharge in the most economic or most energy efficient way. It is furthermore \nrequired to develop efficient and convenient billing systems in order to cover micro‐payments resulting \nfrom charging processes. The necessary communication channel may serve in the future to contribute \nto the stabilization of the electrical grid, as well as to support additional information services required \nto operate electric vehicles efficiently and economically. \nResulting from the physical and data link layer requirements defined in the third part of the standard, a \ncorresponding set of test cases are required in order to verify conformance of implementations. This \ndocument therefore defines a conformance test suite for the physical and data link layer protocols in \norder to derive a common and agreed basis for conformance tests. The resulting test suite is a necessary \nprerequisite for downstream interoperability tests. Since interoperability furthermore involves the \nactual application logic of an implementation, those tests are beyond the scope of this document. Hence \nthis document focuses on the interface aspects and the corresponding requirements given in part three \nonly. \n \n \n \n \nLicensed to National Tsing Hua University / Yi-Shin Chen (yishin@gmail.com) \nISO Store Order: OP-720751 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-10-04 \nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARD \nISO 15118-5:2018(E)\n \n1 \n© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved \n \nRoad vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface — \nPart 5: Physical and data link layer conformance tests \n1 Scope \nThis document specifies conformance tests in the form of an Abstract Test Suite (ATS) for a System \nUnder Test (SUT) implementing an Electric Vehicle or Supply Equipment Communication Controller \n(EVCC or SECC) with support for PLC‐based High Level Communication (HLC) and Basic Signaling \naccording to ISO 15118‐3.
