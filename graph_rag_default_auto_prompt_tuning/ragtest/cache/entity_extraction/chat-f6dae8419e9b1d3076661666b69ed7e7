bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out \nthrough ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical \ncommittee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International \norganizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. \nISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of \nelectrotechnical standardization.\nThe procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are \ndescribed in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the \ndifferent types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the \neditorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of \npatent rights.

They \nare presently developing vehicles partly or completly propelled by electric energy. Thus, vehicles will \nreduce the dependency on oil, improve the global energy efficiency, and reduce the total CO2 emissions \nfor road transportation if the electricity is produced from renewable sources. To charge the batteries of \nsuch vehicles, specific charging infrastructure is required.\nMuch of the standardization work on dimensional and electrical specifications of the charging \ninfrastructure and the vehicle interface is already treated in the relevant ISO or IEC groups. However, \nthe question of information transfer between the vehicle and the grid has not been treated sufficiently.\nSuch communication is beneficial for the optimization of energy resources and energy production \nsystems as vehicles can recharge at the most economic or most energy-efficient instants.\nIt is also required to develop efficient and convenient payment systems in order to cover the resulting \nmicro-payments. The necessary communication channel might serve in the future to contribute to the \nstabilization of the electrical grid, as well as to support additional information services required to \noperate electric vehicles efficiently.\n﻿\nvi\b\n© ISO 2015 – All rights reserved\nLicensed to National Tsing Hua University / Yi-Shin Chen (yishin@gmail.com) \nISO Store Order: OP-720751 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-10-04 \nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n﻿\nRoad vehicles — Vehicle to grid communication interface —\nPart 3:\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
