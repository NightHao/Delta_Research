Introduction
The pending energy crisis and the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has led the vehicle 
manufacturers to a very significant effort to reduce the energy consumption of their vehicles. They 
are presently developing vehicles partly or completly propelled by electric energy. Thus, vehicles will 
reduce the dependency on oil, improve the global energy efficiency, and reduce the total CO2 emissions 
for road transportation if the electricity is produced from renewable sources. To charge the batteries of 
such vehicles, specific charging infrastructure is required.
Much of the standardization work on dimensional and electrical specifications of the charging 
infrastructure and the vehicle interface is already treated in the relevant ISO or IEC groups. However, 
the question of information transfer between the vehicle and the grid has not been treated sufficiently.
Such communication is beneficial for the optimization of energy resources and energy production 
systems as vehicles can recharge at the most economic or most energy-efficient instants.
It is also required to develop efficient and convenient payment systems in order to cover the resulting 
micro-payments. The necessary communication channel might serve in the future to contribute to the 
stabilization of the electrical grid, as well as to support additional information services required to 
operate electric vehicles efficiently.

6.1	 Communication layers overview
This part of ISO 15118 is organized along architectural lines, emphasizing the large-scale separation of 
the system into two parts: the MAC sublayer of the data link layer and the physical layer. These layers 
are intended to correspond closely to the lowest layers of the ISO/IEC model for open systems. Figure 1 
shows the relationship of the [ISO-3] to the OSI reference model.

6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling
This part of ISO 15118 describes in the main body, the general requirements to the communication. 
Specific requirements depending on the technology are described in the Annex A.
6.2.1	
Basic signalling
[V2G3-M06-01]
The basic signalling follows [IEC-1]. All timings shall be compliant with the [IEC-1], 
Annex A.
Any charging process, no matter the presence of high-level communication, uses the bidirectional 
signalling according to [IEC-1], indicating EV related information through control pilot states and EVSE 
related information through the duty cycle of the control pilot signal.
6.2.2	
High-level communication
[V2G3-M06-02]
The HLC shall be used in addition to the basic signalling in order to enable a bidi-
rectional communication and offer additional features.
The sequence of the data exchange within the HLC-based charging session is done in accordance with 
the [ISO-2] communication protocol.
It can be split into three periods as follows:
—	 data link setup;
—	 V2G setup;
—	 V2G charging loop.
NOTE	
The detailed descriptions are given in [ISO-2].

﻿
ISO 15118-3:2015(E)
[V2G3-M06-03]
During the V2G charging loop, the PWM duty cycle shall not change due to dynam-
ically changed grid information. Those dynamically changed grid limitations shall 
be provided through the high-level communication messages.
In case basic charging is used as back-up of HLC-C (e.g. when HLC-C has failed), the duty cycle is allowed 
to change due to dynamically changed grid information, according [IEC-1] requirements.
6.3 Identification requirements
The initialization phase depends on whether identification “ID from EV” or EIM is required, as described 
in [ISO-1], use-cases D1, D2, D3, and D4.
[V2G3-M06-04]
When authorization (payment) is required for charging, the EVSE shall offer PnC 
(ID from EV) or EIM means.
Any payment included in a package (parking fee, in a flat rate, etc.) is considered as “No ID required” 
since the energy is paid for by means totally independent of the EVSE.
NOTE 1	
The need for authentication can be externally triggered.
NOTE 2	
The “ID required” covers only the ID for operating purposes and does not cover all the identification 
linked to the “security” as described in the [ISO-2].
NOTE 3	
The feature PnC is called “ID from EV”, using the message set of [ISO-2].
NOTE 4	
At a publicly accessible EVSE with only “ID from EV”, there might be a fallback solution to allow any EV 
to be able to charge.
If the duty cycle is set to 5 % and PnC is intended to be used, the EVCC may launch an “ID recognition” 
from the EV (Use-case D1 and D2 of [ISO-1]). According to the EV’s answer, the SECC may decide to allow 
the charge or not.
6.4	 System requirements
In the following subclauses, the abbreviations concerning the control pilot states (eg X1, X2, B1, B2, etc.), 
are described in [IEC-3].
6.4.1	
Overview
This Clause defines the requirements on the triggering of the EVSE and the EV immediately after the 
plug-in of the cable assembly. It includes the specifications of sequences, when and how the contract ID 
is recognized, when to launch the matching process (at the MAC level), and how to decide to use basic 
charging or high-level communication charging.
6.4.2	
EVSE
6.4.2.1	
Control pilot requirements
Each EVSE outlet has its own dedicated pilot function controller.
The trigger and timing relations between basic signalling and HLC connection setup are described in Clause 7.
For implementation and synchronization between [IEC-1] and [ISO-3], please refer to [ISO-2] 8.7.4.
NOTE 1	
If a nominal duty cycle is set, it is recommended to keep it as the maximum current capacity of the 
charging station and let the high-level communication messages dynamically adjust the available max current.

ISO 15118-3:2015(E)
[V2G3-M06-05]
In case no communication could be established with a 5 % control pilot duty cycle 
(matching process not started), if the EVSE wants to switch to a nominal duty cycle, 
then the change from 5 % to a nominal duty cycle shall be done with a specific 
sequence B2 or C2 (5 %) -> E or F -> B2 (nominal value) to allow backward compati-
bility. The minimum time at the control pilot state E or F is defined to T_step_EF.
NOTE 2	
Each EVSE supplier is free to choose between the state E and the state F to make the transition, 
according to its implementation.
[V2G3-M06-06]
In case a communication has already been established within 5 % control pilot duty 
cycle (“Matched state” reached or matching process ongoing), a change from 5 % 
to a nominal duty cycle shall be done with a X1 state in the middle (minimum time 
as defined in [IEC-3] Seq 9.2), to signal the EV that the control pilot duty cycle will 
change to a nominal duty cycle.
[V2G3 M06-07]
If an AC EVSE applies a 5 % control pilot duty cycle, and the EVSE receives no SLAC 
request within TT_EVSE_SLAC_init, the EVSE shall go to state E or F for T_step_EF, 
shall go back to 5 % duty cycle, and shall reset the TT_EVSE_SLAC_init timeout 
before being ready to answer a matching request again. This sequence shall be 
retried C_sequ_retry times. At the end, without any reaction, the EVSE shall go to 
state X1.
NOTE 3	
In the X1 control pilot state, a customer can make an EIM action at any time.
[V2G3-M06-08]
After positive EIM, if no matching process is running, the EVSE shall signal control 
pilot state E/F for T_step_EF, then signal control pilot state X1/X2 (nominal).
[V2G3 -M06-09]
If a control pilot state E/F -> Bx, Cx, Dx transition is used for triggering retries or 
legacy issues, the state E/F shall be at least T_step_EF.
6.4.2.2	
Low-layer communication requirements
The [ISO-1], Annex A provides examples for charging infrastructure architectures.
The matching process is designed for working between the low-layer communication module locally 
assigned to each socket-outlet, on the EVSE side, and the EVCC.
NOTE 1	
The complete matching process description is given in Clause 9.
[V2G3-M06-10]
In case of charging station enclosures with multiple socket-outlets or attached 
cables and only one low-layer communication module managing the complete sta-
tion, these shall behave as an individual low-layer communication module for each 
outlet.
NOTE 2	
It’s highly recommended to build a point to point architecture (one low-layer communication module 
on EVSE side, and one low-layer communication module per EV).
[V2G3-M06-11]
The matching process shall be launched by a transition from state A, E, or F to state 
Bx, Cx, or Dx.
6.4.3	
EV
6.4.3.1	
Control pilot requirements
On seeing a nominal duty cycle, the EV may launch the charge at any time.
[V2G3-M06-12]
In the HLC-C mode, in case of a nominal duty cycle, the vehicle shall determine the 
maximum charge current, defined by the EVSE, by calculating the minimum of the 
following values:

6.4.3.2	
Low-layer communication requirements
[V2G3-M06-13]
The matching process shall be launched by a transition from state A, E, or F to state 
Bx, Cx, or Dx.
[V2G3-M06-14]
The EV shall always charge in the HLC-C mode, as soon as V2G charging loop is 
started.
Within the V2G charging loop, the EV is not allowed to charge in the basic charging mode.
Before the V2G charging loop and after the V2G communication session, the EV is allowed to charge in 
the basic charging mode in case of nominal control pilot duty cycle.
In case of AC-charging, an EV should be capable to switch from a HLC-C mode to a basic charging mode, 
if an error occurs on the high-level communication, even if a HLC-C mode is already launched.
[V2G3-M06-15]
During a matching process, a change in the duty cycle shall not terminate/interrupt 
the matching process on EV side.
6.5 Configuration of a low-layer communication module
If there is a coexistence issue with the grid, technical decisions including application of alternative PLC 
standard technologies like ISO/IEC 12139-1, should be considered in that situation: KR.
Coexistence mechanisms are not defined in this part of ISO 15118.
[V2G3-M06-16]
Each communication node shall provide a method to exchange authorized frequen-
cies to be used, to be in line with frequency restrictions. A communication node 
shall respect the spectrum limitation sent by the counterpart node.
NOTE	
All EVSEs should be able to update the set of frequencies to be used according to future legislative 
regulations.
7	 Connection coordination
7.1	 General

7.3	 Plug-in phase
This phase covers the plug-in up to the beginning of the charge.
7.3.1	
EVSE side
[V2G3-M07-01]
After successful detection of the plug-in of a cable assembly, the low-layer commu-
nication module shall be ready for communication in less than T_conn_max_comm.
NOTE 1	
Plug-in detection by EVSE can be done either by proximity pin detection or by closed control pilot.
During a plug-in phasis, AC EVSEs with Type 2 outlet or DC EVSEs with Type 1 connector should only apply 
a voltage to the control pilot when the low-layer communication module is ready for communication. 
This speeds up the communication setup.
[V2G3-M07-02]
The EVSE shall only apply 5 % control pilot duty cycle if the low-layer communica-
tion module is ready for communication (receive first SLAC message).
According to the initialization process, an EVSE should be prepared to receive EIM identification, if 
offered, at any time.
NOTE 2	
The EIM sequence is compliant with the use-case A2 from [ISO-1].
7.3.2	
EV side
When detecting a nominal duty cycle, the EV can either start charging in the basic charging mode or 
wait until the HLC-C mode is established.
7.4	 Initialization phase
When the V2G Data link setup is successful and if the PnC identification mode is implemented, further 
identification is managed by higher layers as described in [ISO-2] (e.g. ID recognition).

﻿
ISO 15118-3:2015(E)
According to that ID recognition, the EVSE will decide whether to authorize the charge or to not 
authorize the charge.
7.5	 Loss of communication
This Clause covers the situation where the communication link is lost. A loss of communication after 
the establishment of a data link [D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) was already indicated] is 
handled by higher layers, by requesting with D-LINK_ERROR.request.
[V2G3-M07-03]
If a data link was established and a D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) was 
already indicated to higher layers, any detected loss of the data link shall cause a 
D-LINK_READY.indication(no link) indication to higher layers.
7.5.1	
EVSE side
[V2G3-M07-04]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE in X1 state, the EVSE’s commu-
nication node shall perform a state X1 to state E/F to state X1 or X2 transition.
7.5.1.1	
Error handling with a Control Pilot duty cycle of 5 %
[V2G3-M07-05]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request in X2 state from HLE, the EVSE’s commu-
nication node shall perform a state X2 to X1 to state E/F to state X1 or X2 transi-
tion.
[V2G3-M07-06]
Within the control pilot state X1, the communication node shall leave the logical 
network and change the matching state to “Unmatched”.
[V2G3-M07-07]
With reaching the state “Unmatched”, the EVSE shall switch to state E/F.
[V2G3-M07-08]
The state E/F shall be applied at least T_step_EF.
[V2G3-M07-09]
After applying state E/F, the EVSE shall switch to contol pilot state X1 or X2 as 
soon as the EVSE is ready for incoming matching requests.
7.5.1.2	
Error handling with nominal control pilot duty cycle
[V2G3-M07-10]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE, the EVSE’s communication 
node shall implement one of the two following options:
Option A: to have behaviour independent of the duty cycle:
[V2G3-M07-11]
The requirements of 7.5.1.1 shall be applied to have behaviour independent of the 
duty cycle.
Option B: not to interrupt charging due to a control pilot state change to state E:
[V2G3-M07-12]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE, the EVSE’s communication 
node shall stay in X2 control pilot state, leave the logical network within TP_
match_leave, and change the matching state to “Unmatched” to be ready for a new 
matching process.
7.5.2	
EV side
If the EV detects a loss of communication, it can either switch to basic charging mode or stop the charge. 
While relaunching the matching process, the EV may go on charging in the basic charging mode, if the 
EVSE sets a nominal duty cycle.
NOTE	
The matching process after a loss of communication is exactly the same as during a plug-in phasis.

7.5.2.1	
Error handling with control pilot duty cycle of 5 %
[V2G3-M07-13]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE, the EV’s communication node 
shall change to Bx state, leave the logical network and change the matching state 
to “Unmatched” within TP_match_leave and wait for a new incoming matching 
trigger (control pilot X1 or X2 state).
7.5.2.2	
Error handling with nominal control pilot duty cycle
[V2G3-M07-14]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE, the EV’s communication node 
shall implement one of the two following options:
Option A: to have behaviour independent of the duty cycle:
[V2G3-M07-15]
The requirements of 7.5.2.1 shall be applied to have behaviour independent of the 
duty cycle.
Option B: not to interrupt charging due to a control pilot state change to state E:
[V2G3-M07-16]
With receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request from HLE, the EV’s communication node 
shall keep the current state and leave the logical network and change the matching 
state to “unmatched”.
[V2G3-M07-17]
T_conn_resetup after the condition in [V2G3-M07-16] is met; the EV shall restart 
the Matching process.
[V2G3-M07-18]
During the T_conn_resetup waiting state according to [V2G3-M07-17], the EV shall 
be prepared to be forced to restart by an EVSE, which has implemented option A 
according to [V2G3-M07-10].
7.6	 Sleep mode and wake-up
A sleep mode is used for energy saving. EV and EVSE can enter a sleep mode after negotiating a pause 
through HLC protocol.
On the EVSE side, a sleep mode means that the oscillator will be off (X1 Control Pilot state), the +12V 
supply of the pilot line will stay on, and the low-layer communication module may be powered off.
On the EV side, a sleep mode means state B and the low-layer communication module may be powered 
off. The wake-up mechanisms may also be used after charge session was already terminated to allow 
the counterpart station to reestablish HLC.
7.6.1	
Entering the sleep mode
[V2G3-M07-19]
With receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, the EV shall change to control pilot state 
Bx. Unpowering the low-layer communication module is optional. The logical net-
work parameter set shall be stored for continuing the data link after the sleeping 
phase.
[V2G3-M07-20]
With receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, the EVSE shall switch to control pilot 
state X1 and may switch the low-layer communication module into low-power 
mode. The logical network parameter set shall be stored for continuing the data 
link after the sleeping phase.
7.6.2	
Wake-up
[V2G3-M07-21]
As soon as the lower layers detect a data link after a wake-up, it shall send a 
D-LINK_READY.indication(link established) to HLE.

[V2G3-M07-22]
If the EVSE or EV is in “Matched state” and has been woken up from the counter-
part station, the low-layer communication module shall be configured to the last 
known logical network parameter set.
[V2G3-M07-23]
In case of a wake up trigger from the counterpart station, the low-layer communi-
cation module shall be ready in maximum T_conn_resume after the trigger (B1/
B2, BCB-Toggle).
7.6.2.1	
EVSE side
[V2G3-M07-24]
To wake-up the EV, the pilot function controller on EVSE side shall be configured 
to the last known parameter set and the oszillator shall perform a B1/B2 transi-
tion.
[V2G3-M07-25]
As soon as the EVSE is ready to charge and ready to communicate after a wake-up 
from EV, it shall switch to X2 state.
[V2G3-M07-26]
If the EVSE is in a charge pause, it shall wake up by detecting a BCB-Toggle and 
shall configure the low-layer communication module to the last known logical 
network parameter.

9	 Matching EV — EVSE process
9.1	 Overview
A unique matching between the EV and a specific charge coupler of the EVSE is necessary for most of 
the use cases. After the matching process, which is defined within this Clause, upper layers are able 
to proceed their binding process. Interfaces related to data link status between the layers are defined 
in Clause  12. Depending on the communication signal paths, the matching process depends on the 
infrastructure topology.
Under some technical conditions, the matching process might render ambiguous results. In this case, 
an additional validation process based on a signalling through the control pilot line can be necessary to 
confirm the matching.
Figure  10 gives a generic overview of the matching process. The full description is given in the 
corresponding annex.

Figure 11 — Matching state machine
Figure 11 shows a high-level overview of the matching process. The default state of a PLC node at plug-
in is “Unmatched”. A control pilot state change from state A, E or F to B, C or D triggers the matching 
process (state “Matching” in Figure  11) which determines the correct EV-EVSE matching by signal 
strength measurement. A successful matching process leads to the state “Matched” in Figure 11.
Any transition from the state “Matching” triggers a call of the primitive D-LINK_READY.indication to 
indicate a successful or failed data-link setup.
Any loss of the control pilot or a request from HLE leads to a reset to state “Unmatched”.
9.2	 Initialization of matching process
The first phase of the matching process is called initialization of matching process. During this phase, 
the node is configured in order to enhance the matching process.
9.3	 Discovery of the connected low-layer communication module
During the discovery process, the EV determines which EVSE is directly connected to its cable assembly.
The method is based on a measurement of the signal strength. The EV will discover all the communication 
nodes in range, measure, and compare signal strengths and will choose the communication nodes. See 
the corresponding annexes for more details.
[V2G3-M09-01]
The EVSE shall be able to handle at least C_EVSE_match_parallel processes in paral-
lel to be able to serve multiple matching processes in case of crosstalk.
NOTE 1	
In case multiple EVs plug in at the same time, an EVSE has to handle multiple matching processes 
coming from direct and also crosstalked PLC signals.
[V2G3-M09-02]
All [ISO-3] communication nodes in the network shall be compliant with a method 
of measurement based on the signal strength.

[V2G3-M09-03]
Only EV communication nodes shall send requests based on this signal strength 
method.
[V2G3-M09-04]
Only EVSE communication nodes shall answer to the requests based on this signal 
strength measurement.
[V2G3-M09-05]
The signal strength measurement shall be concluded by the following:
 
—    EVSE_FOUND: signal strength measurement confirms the physical matching;
 
—    EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND: signal strength measurement does not give a 
distinct physical matching, validation might be required;
 
—    EVSE_NOT_FOUND: signal strength measurement confirms that no physical 
matching exists.
NOTE 2	
The exact usage of the terms “EVSE_FOUND”, “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”, and “EVSE_NOT_FOUND” 
are in the corresponding annexes.
According to the use-cases, each EVCC may consider the status “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” as 
“EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”.
According to the use-cases, each EVCC may consider the status “EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_
FOUND” as only “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”.
If the EV status is “EVSE_FOUND”, the validation process is optional.
9.4	 Validation of matching decision
The validation of matching decision is a method to validate the signal strength measurement through an 
additional independent path, based on the hardwired control pilot line.
If a validation of matching decision is required to confirm that the EV is connected to the right low-
layer communication module, the following requirements are considered as mandatory if validation of 
matching is supported.
NOTE	
To support a BCB-Toggle for Wake-up is mandatory on EVSE side.
After the signal strength measurement, the EV can decide on the basis of the results to request the 
EVSE for an additional validation process. As soon as the EVSE is ready to detect the control pilot line, 
the EV sends a random timer value TP_EV_vald_toggle to the EVSE. After sending the message, the EV 
switches the control pilot state in the sequence B-C-B. This switching sequence is called BCB-Toggle in 
the following.
According to the EVSE architecture, the EVSE can answer to the request by the following certain states.
—	 “Not Required” state: This is just a recommendation from the EVSE, the EV decides either to follow 
the EVSE recommendation and to skip the validation process or to continue the process and to 
perform the validation process.
—	 “Failure” state: This is an indication from the EVSE that it does not support the validation process. 
The EV decides to either terminate the matching process with the current EVSE and go on with the 
next EVSE or to skip the validation process with the current EVSE.
—	 “Ready” state: This is an indication from the EVSE that it does support the validation process and is 
ready to continue the validation process.
In case of a performed validation process, the EV performs multiple BCB-Toggles during the time TP_EV_
vald_toggle. The number of BCB-Toggles (C_EV_vald_nb_toggles) is chosen randomly in the available time.
At the end of the timer, the EVSE sends a frame with the number of BCB-Toggles seen on the Control Pilot 
line and waits for the decision value.

[V2G3-M09-07]
If the EV status is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”, the EV shall start the validation 
process. According to the grid architecture, the EVSE can inform the EV that it is 
allowed to abort the validation process. In such a case, the EV has the option to 
skip the validation process.
[V2G3-M09-08]
According to its implementation, the EVSE can inform the EV that it does not sup-
port the validation process. The EV decides to either terminate the matching pro-
cess with the current EVSE and go on with the next EVSE or to skip the validation 
process with the current EVSE.
[V2G3-M09-09]
Since the communication node on EV side concludes the signal strength measure-
ment, the communication node on EV side shall also conclude this mechanism. 
This method shall be concluded by
 
—    EVSE_FOUND
 
—    EVSE_NOT_FOUND.
NOTE	
At this stage, the validation is physically performed with the control pilot line. The “EVSE_
POTENTIALLY_FOUND” state is not possible.
The following requirements only apply in case both the EV and the EVSE support the validation process:
[V2G3-M09-10]
The EVSE shall be able to detect a state variation on the control pilot line within 
T_vald_detect_time.
[V2G3-M09-11]
The duration of each state during the BCB-Toggle sequence is defined as TP_EV_
vald_state_duration.
[V2G3-M09-12]
Both EV and EVSE shall support a set of messages to exchange the number of 
BCB-Toggles, using the messages defined in dedicated annexes.

BCB-Toggles.
[V2G3-M09-15]
The control pilot duty cycle shall not have an impact on the validation process.
9.5	 Set-up a logical network
According to the low-layer communication technology, a logical network might have to be built in order 
to enhance the communication.
[V2G3-M09-16]
As soon as the EV has successfully joined the logical network of the EVSE, both 
entities are in the status “Matched”. The communication node shall inform HLE 
through the D-LINK_READY.indication (link established) that HLE’s binding pro-
cess can begin.
9.6	 Leave the logical network
[V2G3-M09-17]
With receiving a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request from HLE, the communication node 
shall leave the logical network within TP_match_leave. All parameters related 
to the current link shall be set to the default value and shall change to the status 
“Unmatched”.
[V2G3-M09-18]
When the low-layer communication module leaves the logical network, it shall 
inform HLE through the D-LINK_READY.indication (no link).
9.7	 Error handling
[V2G3-M09-19]
In the following cases, the communication node shall leave the logical network 
within TP_match_leave. All parameters related to the current link shall be set to 
the default value and shall change to the status “Unmatched”.
 
—    The state A is detected on EVSE side
 
—    The state E is detected on EV side

12	Layer 2 interfaces
12.1	Overview
This Clause describes the terminology primitives used within this part of ISO 15118. It is for explanation 
and for definition of a unique terminology only. This terminology is implementation independent.
As shown in Figure 2, the definition of the data link layer provides the following two interfaces to 
higher layers.
—	 Data SAP is the interface between the communication technology and the layer 3 (e.g. IPv6).
—	 The data link control SAP provides link status information, error information, control functionality 
and is located between the connection coordination and higher layers.
12.2	Data SAP
The data SAP interfaces higher layer data to a low-layer communication technologies data link layer.
12.3	Data link control SAP to layer 3
These primitives are defined according to [ISO-2].
[V2G3-M12-01]
The D-LINK_READY.indication shall inform higher layers about a change of com-
munication link status. This indication shall be sent with any change in link status.

HomePlug Green PHY Specification
A.6	 System architecture
A.6.1	 Layers overview
Figure 2 gives an overview of the structure.
As shown in Figure 2, the definition of the data link layer provides two interfaces to higher layers; the 
ETH SAP and the data link control SAP.
A.6.1.1	 Communication media
In this Annex, the communication media block as shown in Figure 2 is the control pilot line ([IEC-1], Annex A).
A.6.1.2	 Data SAP
The data SAP is the ETH SAP. The ETH SAP is completely covered by the [HPGP].
Due to the convergence layer, the data link layer of HomePlug Green PHY provides an Ethernet II-class 
SAP to higher layers.
This SAP supports applications using Ethernet II-class packets, including IEEE 802.3 with or without 
IEEE 802.2 (LLC), IEEE 802.1H (SNAP) extensions, and/or VLAN tagging.
The data link control SAP indicates link status and error information to higher layers and is provided by 
the connection coordination entity.
A.6.1.3	 Signal coupling
The signal coupling interface is described in A.11.
A.6.1.4	 MAC/PHY stack
The highlighted entities of Figure 2 represent the whole HomePlug Green PHY MAC and PHY layer and are 
covered by [HPGP]. The convergence layer adapts the generic HomePlug Green PHY MAC to an IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet II-class interface through the ETH SAP. The control SAP provides a control interface to access 
HomePlug GreenPHY specific data and configuration for network management, including encryption 
key management, SLAC services, and link status information.
A.6.1.5	 Connection coordination
There are no additional requirements for the technology.
A.6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling
There are no additional requirements for the technology.

This subclause is a summary of some key points of HomePlug Green PHY technology that this part of 
ISO 15118 requires.
The physical layer of the HomePlug Green PHY technology is fully described in [HPGP].
A.6.5.1	 Shared bandwidth mechanisms
NOTE 1	
Coexistence mechanisms with other HomePlug technologies are addressed in [HPGP].
A.6.5.1.1	 ISP
[HPGP] implements the ISP as a coexistence mechanism. The ISP, defined by [IEEE], allows coexistence 
between devices that implement non-interoperable protocols. Using ISP, 1901 access, 1901 wavelet, 
1901 FFT, LRWBS, and ITU-T G.hn, devices are able to coexist.
[V2G3-A06-01]
The low-layer communication module on the EVSE side shall be capable to detect 
the zero cross of the AC line cycle to support coexistence functionality.
NOTE 2	
Coexistence mechanisms with other technologies, covered by [IEEE], are a requirement in [HPGP].
A.6.5.1.2	 Coexistence with HomePlug AV technologies
In addition to the coexistence mechanisms with other HomePlug technologies, there is a specificity 
regarding the HomePlug AV technology: In case of coexistence with a fully loaded HomePlug AV, the 
HomePlug Green PHY may be limited to 7 % in time. This can affect the data rate.
A.6.5.2	 Functional description
After this process, the low-layer communication module is configured to a defined state. This configuration 
is a precondition for the matching process and is done latest with entering the matching process.
[V2G3-A06-02]
The low-layer communication module on the EV side shall be configured in order 
to never become the CCo.
[V2G3-A06-03]

A.9.2	 Signal strength measurement
A.9.2.1	 Functional description
By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes 
are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation 
of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back 
to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.
After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_
start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC 
number of M-SOUNDS. Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and 
send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_
CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP.
The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP].
 
[V2G3-A09-17]
The SLAC implementation of the low-layer communciation module on EV and 
EVSE side shall be compliant with the messages defined in [HPGP].
[V2G3-A09-18]
The low-layer communciation module on EV and EVSE sides shall be compliant 
with the sequence diagram of Figure A.1.
[V2G3-A09-19]
The ATTEN_PROFILE within the message CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND shall be calcu-
lated by arithmetic mean of the ATTEN_PROFILE of the CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND 
of previous M-SOUNDS corrected by the attenuation of the receive path AttnRx-
EVSE as described in A.9.4.1.
[V2G3-A09-20]
The Average_Attenuation used for matching decision shall be calculated by the 
arithmetic mean of all groups in the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. To take 
implementation specifics into account, a weighted average may be used. When 
using a weighted average, the sum of the weights of all groups shall be one.
[V2G3-A09-21]
According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module 
on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after 
the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
 
—    if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation 
module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as 
described in A.7.4;

[V2G3-A09-25]
With receiving a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF, the EV shall start the timer TP_match_

sequence of C_EV_start_atten_char_inds CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND messages.
[V2G3-A09-26]
The time duration between consecutive CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND messages 
shall be TP_EV_batch_msg_interval.

sequence, the EV shall wait for TP_EV_batch_msg_interval before starting the 
CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND message sequence.
[V2G3-A09-28]
Within CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND message sequence, the EV shall transmit the CM_
MNBC_SOUND.IND message C_EV_match_MNBC times. With each message, the

The EV shall start the timeout timer TT_EV_atten_results when sending the first 
CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND.
[V2G3-A09-31]
While the timer TT_EV_atten_results is running, the EV shall process incoming 
CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND messages. If the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND messages from 
all EVSEs are received, which were recognized during the parameter exchange, 
the EV is allowed to stop the TT_EV_atten_results timer and continue the match-
ing process. To be able to service also EVSEs which were not received during the 
parameter exchange, the EV may wait for incoming CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND mes-
sages until the TT_EV_atten_results timer expires before continuing the matching 
process.
[V2G3-A09-32]
If no CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND is received before TT_EV_atten_results expires, the 
matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
[V2G3-A09-33]
If a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND is received and its origin is an EVSE that has not sent a 
CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF before, the message shall be processed and not ignored.

TT_EVSE_match_MNBC timer.
[V2G3-A09-43]
While the timer TT_EVSE_match_MNBC is running, the EVSE shall receive and 
process incoming CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND messages. If the anticipated number 
of CM_ATTEN_PROFILE messages is not achieved, the EVSE shall keep listening 
for incoming CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND messages until the timer TT_EVSE_match_
MNBC expires.
[V2G3-A09-44]
If all M-Sound messages are received by the EVSE or the TT_EVSE_match_MNBC 
timer expires, the EVSE shall compute (analyse and average) all received CM_
ATTEN_PROFILE messages within the time window given by the TP_EVSE_avg_
atten_calc timer. This performance timer shall be started as soon as TT_EVSE_
match_MNBC expires.
[V2G3-A09-45]
After having computed all received data, the EVSE shall send a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.
IND within TP_EVSE_avg_atten_calc and start the timer TT_match_response.
[V2G3-A09-46]
If the EVSE has not received a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP within TT_match_response, 
it shall retransmit a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND when the TT_match_response expires 
and reset this timer. After C_EV_match_retry attempts, if no CM_ATTEN_CHAR.
RSP is received by the EVSE, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.

If the EVSE receives a CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP with invalid content, it shall be 
ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.4 is invalid.
A.9.3	 Validation of matching decision
A.9.3.1	 Functional description
The validation of matching decision is a method to validate the SLAC based matching by means of the 
control pilot line. In case the EV is not able to come to a distinct matching decision on base of the signal 
strength measurement, it may decide to do an additional validation process. The validation process is 
divided in two parts consisting of a CM_VALIDATE.REQ and CM_VALIDATE.CNF each. It is important 
to consider that the first and second request-response differ in the contents of the messages. In the 
following messages related to the first/second request-response are designated with “step 1” or “step 
2”, respectively.
The validation process is an asynchronous process, which means that an unmatched EVSE answers to 
a CM_VALIDATE.REQ in any case even with no signal strength measurement immediately before. This 
behaviour is necessary because the time between the signal strength measurement and the validation 
for a specific EVSE is not predictable due to an unknown number of validation processes with other 
EVSEs before.
To request a validation process, the EV sends a first CM_VALIDATE.REQ to the EVSE, which contains a 
timer value of zero and a result field indicating “ready”. The EVSE responds with a first CM_VALIDATE.

CNF, which contains a ToggleNum of zero. The result field of the message is filled in consistence with the 
current state of the EVSE:
—	 When the EVSE is ready to perform the validation process, it fills the result field with “ready”. In this 
case, the EV will continue with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ.
—	 When the EVSE is busy and not able to perform a validation, it fills the result field with “not ready”. 
In this case, the EVSE is not ready for the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ. The EV may start a retry by 
resending the first CM_VALIDATE.REQ again.
—	 When the EVSE wants to indicate that a validation is not required, it fills the result field with 
“not required”. In this case, the EV may follow this advice and stop the validation process or continue the 
process with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ to force the EVSE to follow the validation process.
—	 In any special case where the EVSE is not able to perform any validation process or it does not have 
implemented the validation process feature, it fills the result field with “failure”.
The second part of the validation process covers the control pilot toggle sequence on EV side and the 
counting of control pilot toggles on the EVSE side. The EV starts this process by sending the step 2 
indicating “ready”. With receiving the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ, the EVSE starts counting the BCB-
toggles for a time window given by the timer field of the request. As soon as the timer expires, the 
EVSE sends a step 2 CM_VALIDATE.CNF to the EV containing the number of BCB-Toggles seen and the 
result field filled with “Success”. The field is filled with “failure” whenever the validation could not be 
performed or the number of seen BCB-Toggles does not contain valid data.
In the case the validation does not confirm the matching decision of the signal strength measurement, 
the EV may continue with the next potential EVSE.
The main process is described in 9.4.
[V2G3-A09-48]
If the EV_Discovering_Status is “EVSE_FOUND”, validation shall only be performed 
if the EV insists to. Otherwise, the validation process shall be skipped.
[V2G3-A09-49]
If the EV decides that “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” is equal to “EVSE_FOUND”, 
then a BCB-Toggle is not mandatory.
[V2G3-A09-50]
According to the EVSE Architecture, the EVSE can decide to answer to a CM_VAL-
IDATE.REQ with the result field of CM_VALIDATE.CNF filled to “Not_Required”. In 
this case, the EV shall decide
 
—    either to continue the validation process, by continuing with the step 2 CM_
VALIDATE.REQ, or
 
—    either to skip the validation process by informing the EVSE of the decision, 
using the CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ.
[V2G3-A09-51]
According to the EVSE Implementation, the EVSE can decide to answer to a 
CM_VALIDATE.REQ with the result field of CM_VALIDATE.CNF filled to “Failure”, 
if it does not have implemented the validation process feature. In this case, the EV 
shall decide
 
—    either to skip the validation process and continue the matching process with 
SLAC_MATCH.REQ message,
 
—    either to continue the validation process with the next available EVSE, which 
was “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” according to Figure 10, or
 
—    either to terminate the session if there is no other available EVSE with “EVSE_
POTENTIALLY_FOUND” status according to Figure 10.

A.9.4.3.2	 EV side
[V2G3-A09-94]
If the EV has sent a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ to the EVSE but does not receive a valid 
CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF within the max(TT_match_response), it shall retransmit 
the CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ. The timer shall be restarted with any retry. A max-
imum of C_EV_match_retry retransmissions shall be performed. If after these 
retransmissions the EV has not received valid response within max (TT_match_
response), the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
[V2G3-A09-95]
If the EV receives a CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF with invalid content, it shall be ignored. 
Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.7 is invalid.
A.9.4.3.3	 EVSE side
[V2G3-A09-96]
According to the decision of the EV, if the EVSE does not receive either CM_SLAC_
MATCH.REQ or a CM_VALIDATE.REQ within the maximum value of TT_EVSE_
match_session, the EVSE shall consider that it is not connected to the EV and shall 
consider the matching process as FAILED.
[V2G3-A09-97]
If the EVSE receives another CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ from the same EV, this means 
that the EV retransmitted its request for some reason (i.e. the CM_SLAC_MATCH.
CNF was not received). The EVSE shall respond to the request again.
[V2G3-A09-98]
If the EVSE receives a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ with invalid content, it shall be 
ignored. Content which deviate from the MME definition in Table A.7 is invalid.
[V2G3-A09-99]
After receiving a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ, the EVSE shall answer by a CM_SLAC_
MATCH.CNF within TP_match_response.
A.9.5	 Joining the logical network
A.9.5.1	 Functional description
After the right matching between EV and EVSE is determined and the network parameters are exchanged, 
the EV joins the logical network of the EVSE. Through the broadcast domain is reduced to the low-layer 
communciation module directly connected.
The configuration of the low-layer communication module with the parameters of the logical network 
may be done with the MMEs CM_SET_KEY.REQ and CM_SET_KEY.CNF.
On EVSE side, there is no constraint that the network parameters have to be configured after the CM_
SLAC_MATCH.CNF. This can also be done any time before.
[V2G3-A09-100]
The low-layer communciation module shall join the logical network only if the EV_
Discovering_status is EVSE_FOUND.

A.9.5.3.2	 EV side
[V2G3-A09-101]
After receiving a CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF from the EVSE, the EV shall configure its 
low-layer communciation module to the values from this message by using the 
CM_SET_KEY.REQ MME.
NOTE 1	
In a specific implementation, methods other than the CM_SET_KEY MMEs may also be used as long as 
the configuration result is equivalent.
NOTE 2	
It is up to the implementation how to handle a negative response in a CM_SET_KEY.CNF or a missing 
CM_SET_KEY.CNF at all.
[V2G3-A09-102]
If no link is established within the max(TT_match_join) after receiving CM_SLAC_
MATCH.CNF, the EV shall consider that the matching process is FAILED.
A.9.5.3.3	 EVSE side
[V2G3-A09-103]
After sending a CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF containing a NMK and a NID, the EVSE 
shall start its TT_match_join timer. This timer ends when the CCo detects a link in 
its logical network.
[V2G3-A09-104]
If no link is detected when the TT_match_join timer expires, the EVSE shall con-
sider the matching process as FAILED.
[V2G3-A09-105]
The EVSE shall configure its low-layer communciation module to the NID and 
NMK values sent in CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF at the latest after sending the 
CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF. The configuration can also be done at any time before (e.g. 
after unplugging of a previous EV). The configuration shall be done by sending a 
CM_SET_KEY.REQ.
NOTE 3	
If the EVSE needs to configure its NMK and NID after the CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF, it should consider 
that the just sent CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF might get lost and the EV will send a CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ retry within 
TT_match_response. Within this time, the EVSE should not be blind due to the configuration process for the 
incoming CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ retry.
A.9.6	 Amplitude map exchange
A.9.6.1	 Functional description
The amplitude map exchange is an optional function to request the counterpart low-layer communciation 
module to reduce the transmission power for certain carriers. The requesting device sends a 
CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command which has to be confirmed by the counterpart node by a CM_AMP_
MAP.CNF message.
The transmission power limitation request is related to the PSD at EVs/EVSEs socket.
The CM_AMP_MAP.REQ MME has the following two different functions, depending on the 
source/destination of the message:
—	 CM_AMP_MAP.REQ sent from one host to another host through the low-layer communciation is 
designated to transmit the requested transmission power per carrier to the destination host to be 
included in its amplitude map calculation. This message does not have any direct influence on the 
low-layer communciation module transmission power, it is only used for information exchange.
—	 CM_AMP_MAP.REQ sent from one host to the local low-layer communciation module causes the low-
layer communciation module to modify its transmission power.
All transmission power values within the CM_AMP_MAP MMEs are related to a reference value of 
−50 dBm/Hz. The resolution of AMDATA are −2 dB, so that a AMDATA value of 0b0011 means a value −6 dB.

ISO 15118-3:2015(E)
(For simplification, within this example the total number of carriers is fictitious set to 6)
Assumption:
EVSE requests a limitation of the power of carriers 2 and 3 to −78 dBm/Hz, while the other carriers keep 
unaffected. The EV has no limitation request to the EVSE.
—	 The EVSE sends a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ to the EV Host MAC address with the following values: 
{0,14,14,0,0,0}
AMDATA[0] = 0x0
AMDATA[1] = 0xE
AMDATA[2] = 0xE
Related to the reference of −50 dBm/Hz, the requested value of −78 dBm/Hz leads to the difference 
of −28 dB which in turn leads to a raw value of 14 (0xE) for 2 dB resolution. Each element of AMDATA 
has a size of 4 Bit.
—	 The EV Host compares the received values with its default PSD at the socket, which are assumed to 
be {-75, −75, −77, −77, −75, −75} dBm/Hz. For carriers 2 and 3, the requested values are less than the 
default ones:
Carrier 1: −75 dBm/Hz < −50 dBm/Hz:	
ok
Carrier 2: −75 dBm/Hz < −78 dBm/Hz:	
n.ok. devation: 3 dBm/Hz
Carrier 3: −77 dBm/Hz < −78 dBm/Hz:	
n.ok. devation: 1 dBm/Hz
Carrier 4: −77 dBm/Hz < −50 dBm/Hz:	
ok
Carrier 5: −75 dBm/Hz < −50 dBm/Hz:	
ok
Carrier 6: −75 dBm/Hz < −50 dBm/Hz:	
ok
The carriers 2 and 3 have to be reduced in power by 3 dBm/Hz and 1 dBm/Hz respectively.
—	 The EV Host confirms the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ with a corresponding CM_AMP_MAP.CNF.
—	 Based on the calculated attenuation values for the carriers 2 and 3, the EV Host subtract these 
from the default low-layer communciation module setting and writes them to the low-layer 
communciation module using the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ and its local destination address.
[V2G3-A09-106]
In the case that a low-layer communication module requires additional carriers 
to be notched, it shall send the amplitude map to the remote low-layer commu-
nication module as soon as the logical network is set up. Therefore, the sequence 
described in Figure A.2 and A.7.6.2 for detailed primitives shall be used. The 
amplitude map for further communication shall be the intersection of the low-
layer communciation module’s local amplitude and the received amplitude map 
from the remote low-layer communciation module.
[V2G3-A09-107]
As long no exchange of an amplitude map is trigger by one of the low-layer com-
munication modules, a default amplitude map shall be used.
NOTE	
The EVSE should guarantee the conformity to local legislation on authorized/forbidden frequencies in 
the frequency band 2 MHz to 30 MHz. By this mechanism, the EV will always comply with the local legislation. The 
EVSE should be able to be reconfigured to future evolution of restrictions.

response. The timer TT_amp_map_exchange shall be started with the detection of 
other stations in the current logical network.
[V2G3-A09-116]
If the requested node receives another CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, this means that the

MAP.CNF was not received); the requested node shall respond to the request 
again.
[V2G3-A09-117]
If the timer TT_amp_map_exchange expires without receiving a CM_AMP_MAP.
REQ from the counterpart low-layer communication module and without sending 
a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, the D-LINK_READY.indication (link established) shall be 
sent to higher layers.
[V2G3-A09-118]
As soon as the state “Matched” is reached, no further SLAC messages shall be sent 
or processed.
[V2G3-A09-119]
If an amplitude map exchange is initiated by one of the low-layer communication 
modules in the logical network, the higher layer shall not be informed about the 
valid data link before the link is re-established after the amplitude map exchange

A.9.7	 Leave the logical network
This subclause describes a method to allow higher layer to terminate the link. Without the request from 
higher layers to terminate the link, the CCo of the logical network may need several seconds to discover 
that the EV has left the network.

A.11	Signal coupling
A.11.1	Overview
This Clause defines the requirements that have to be fulfilled in order to inject HomePlug Green PHY 
signals into the control pilot line to enable bidirectional HomePlug Green PHY communication between 
one EVSE and one EV.
The HomePlug Green PHY signals on the control pilot line are compliant with [HPGP] except the signal 
coupling, signal levels, and carrier usage.
As HomePlug Green PHY signal’s coupling is directly linked to the control pilot, the schematic in [IEC-1], 
Annex A specification is basis for definitions regarding the control pilot signal.
To enable HomePlug Green PHY injection, the path from EVSE’s output to EV’s input should not be 
considered as capacitive only as it is sufficient for the low frequency control pilot signal. For high frequency 
HomePlug Green PHY, the path should be considered as a transmission line. To take the high frequency 
into account, the control pilot circuit and the component values have to be specified in more detail.
For the control pilot line, the additional capacity of the HomePlug Green PHY coupling circuit has to be 
considered. For the HomePlug Green PHY signal, the partitioning of the capacitive load of the EV, EVSE, 
and the charge cord is important and is detailed in this Clause.
A.11.2 General drawing for HomePlug Green PHY injection
[V2G3-A11-01]
All technical requirements described in this Clause are assumed to have a dedi-
cated pair of HomePlug Green PHY chips implemented for the couple (EVSE, EV), 
linked by a control pilot wire. Figure A.10 depicts an implementation of parallel 
injection and gives definitions used further.

NOTE 4	
L and RDamp associated with capacitors form low pass filters, which ensure the basic signalling and 
HomePlug Green PHY communication at the same time. Through the filters, low frequency signals can pass to 
the control pilot line and high frequency signals are available at the Green PHY modem. The RDamp resistors limit 
resonance effects of the RLC filters.
[V2G3-A11-02]
In case of parallel injection, the HomePlug Green PHY signal shall be coupled 
between the control pilot wire and the PE (Protective Earth) wire.
[V2G3-A11-03]
In case of parallel injection, the HomePlug Green PHY injection circuit on EVSE 
side shall be wired to the control pilot and the PE. Additional components, such as 
EMC or ESD protection, should not affect the HomePlug Green PHY signals.
[V2G3-A11-04]
In case of parallel injection, the HomePlug Green PHY injection circuit on EV side 
shall be wired to the control pilot line and the ground. Additional components, 
such as EMC or ESD protection, should not affect the HomePlug Green PHY sig-
nals.
[V2G3-A11-05]
HomePlug Green PHY shall work with any valid control pilot duty cycle or state as 
defined in [IEC-1].

A proper voltage level and duty cycle of the control pilot raw signal shall be imple-
mented on EVSE side, to ensure [IEC-1] compliancy in presence of an additional 
HomePlug Green PHY signal.
The [ISO-3] highly recommends to apply at least a first order low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 
100 kHz to 200 kHz for measurements on the control pilot signal (e.g. duty cycle or amplitude), not to 
disturb the measurement by high frequency HomePlug Green PHY signals.
A.11.3 Signal requirements for HomePlug Green PHY injection
Table A.11 gives requirements that physical signals shall comply with, in order to enable HomePlug 
Green PHY injection into the control pilot line, according to previous requirements.
NOTE	
The HomePlug Green PHY signal has to be added to control pilot signal on the control pilot line. The 
resulting signal should be the algebraic sum of PWM control pilot signal and of the HomePlug Green PHY signals.
[V2G3-A11-07]
The control pilot line and the PE wires shall be considered as a transmission line 
for the HomePlug Green PHY signal; as defined in Table A.11.

NOTE 1	
Any capacity on the control pilot line which is directly connected between the control pilot line and 
ground should be as small as possible, not to attenuate the HomePlug Green PHY signal in an excessive way. Most 
of the capacitive load should be separated from the high frequency HomePlug Green PHY with the inductor L.
NOTE 2	
At given impedance, the maximum peak to peak amplitude is directly linked to the PSD, also defined 
in Table A.11. For the purpose of limiting the impact of the high frequency signal on the control pilot line, a 
simplification from definition in frequency domain to a peak-to-peak voltage is sufficient.

A.11.4	Signal transmission path and signal measurement
This subclause defines a typical transmission path for the HomePlug Green PHY signal. This includes 
PSDs, attenuations, and measurement procedures. Especially the SLAC method for measuring the signal 
strength needs a well-defined power level for signal transmission.
A.11.4.1	 Typical transmission path
Figure A.11 shows the transmission path for the PLC signal with example values for attenuations and 
PSDs. All PSD and attenuation values are intended as a list of values over carrier groups, single values 
in the following description are given for simplification only. The following are attenuations that are 
assumed as example values
—	 AttnRxEV is the insertion loss of the receiving path between the HomePlug Green PHY Modem and 
the charge coupler on EV side. In the example, a value of 5 dB is assumed (e.g. through to transformers, 
lines, coupling components).
—	 AttnTxEV is the insertion loss of the transmitting path between the HomePlug Green PHY Modem 
and the charge coupler on EV side. In the example, a value of 4 dB is assumed (e.g. through to 
transformers, lines, coupling components).
—	 AttnRxEVSE is the insertion loss of the receiving path between the HomePlug Green PHY Modem 
and the charge coupler on EVSE side. In the example, a value of 3 dB is assumed (e.g. through to 
transformers, lines, coupling components).
—	 AttnTxEVSE is the insertion loss of the transmitting path between the HomePlug Green PHY Modem 
and the charge coupler on EVSE side. In the example, a value of 5 dB is assumed (e.g. through to 
transformers, lines, coupling components).
—	 AttnCord is the insertion loss of the charge cord itself.

Figure A.11 — HomePlug Green PHY-Transmission path example with SLAC relevant 
attenuations and calculations
In the example, the design target is to achieve a PSD at the inlet of device of −76 dBm/Hz over the 
spectrum. Due to insertion losses in the transmission path (AttnTxEV), the output power of the modem 
(−72 dBm/Hz) has to be higher to compensate the attenuation AttnTxEV. The way of measuring the PSD 
for the transmission path is given in A.9.4.2.
The charge cord attenuates the HomePlug Green PHY signal by AttnCord, which leads in the example to 
a PSD at the counterpart socket-outlet of −78 dBm/Hz. Within the EVSE, the signal is also affected by an 
insertion loss (AttnRxEVSE) of the Rx path from the socket-outlet to the Green PHY modem.
Calibration and correction
Rx-Path on EVSE side:
The low-layer communication module on EV side does not know the value of AttnRxEVSE. Since this 
value has an impact on the SLAC measurement, the EVSE has to correct the measurement values by 
AttnRxEVSE before reporting the values back to the EV.
Tx-Path:
Any low-layer communication module has to comply with the transmission power given by the PSD 
range in Table A.11. The measurement procedure to be used is given in A.9.4.2.

ISO 15118-3:2015(E)
Beside the requirement for all low-layer communication modules to comply with the defined PSD values on 
EV side, the exact knowledge of the PSD at the inlet is required as a reference for reported attenuation profiles 
from EVSEs. Any received attenuation profile from an EVSE has to be compared against the reference value 
given by the Tx-PSD at the inlet minus the −50 dBm/Hz reference defined for the SLAC measurement.
A.11.4.2	 Conditions of measurement
In the Figure  A.12, a measurement setup and procedure is defined to determine the electrical 
characteristic of the transmitted signal of a V2G-device in frequency domain by means of a power 
spectrum density (PSD). The numeric values for the PSD is defined in Table A.11 and ensures a comparable 
signal characteristic within a certain tolerance range across V2G devices.

B.7 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling
There are no additional requirements for this technology.
B.8	 Triggering
There are no additional requirements for this technology.
NOTE	
This technology does not require specific signals from the EVSE as it is a point-to-point technology that 
does not require association at the physical layer.
B.9	 Association EV – EVSE procedure
B.9.1	 Overview
The G3-PLC technology on CPLT is a point-to-point communication link that does not require specific 
association procedures for the physical link.
NOTE	
Association requires bi-directional information exchange. The low frequency of the G3-PLC technology 
and the low signal levels used on the CPLT render transfer to the mains impossible. It has been demonstrated that 
crosstalk from mains to pilot wire was detected above 11 Vp. This exceeds the allowed signal level.
B.9.2 Configuration of the PLC node
[V2G3-B09-01]
The PLC node shall be configured in order to use the key “ISOIEC_15118-3” (TBD).
[V2G3-B09-02]
The PLC node shall be configured in order to use the FCC frequency band.
NOTE 1	
There is no need to exchange the frequencies used for communication since the use of the FCC 
frequency band on a medium (the pilot wire) which is decoupled from the Mains is not restricted. Additionally, the 
completion of IEEE 1901.2 and ITU G.9903 Amd1 define global emission limits beyond Cenelec for use in Europe 
and rest of world.
NOTE 2	
Additional identifier can be added in the beacons to specify conformity to ISO 15118.
B.9.3	 Discovery of the connected PLC module
[V2G3-B09-03]
The “Discovery of the connected PLC module” macro bloc is not needed for G3 
technology.
NOTE	
The G3PLC technology supports channel estimation features which allow each G3 PLC communication 
node to set up a neighbour table. The neighbour table gathers a list of essential parameters for each neighbour, 
including the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) which is based on SNR measurements. It is possible to define a threshold 
under which a note would not be considered as a neighbour and will have to be disassociated, however, this 
feature is not considered as necessary given the fact that the G3 PLC allows the establishment of a point-to-point 
link between and EVSE and the physically connected EV.
B.9.4 Validation of the identification of the PLC EVSE
[V2G3-B09-04]
The validation of the identification of the PLC module on the EVSE side is not rele-
vant for G3-PLC technology.
NOTE 1	
The validation of the identification is not applicable for G3-PLC technology.

The bootstrap of a private network using a public key between the EV and the EVSE shall be conformant 
to the following procedure:
—	 EVSE verifies the public key received from EV through the received beacons.
—	 After verification, EVSE assigns a group key to the EV.

The physical layer relies on an OFDM modulation operating in the FCC band. Channel estimation features 
enable the system to automatically adjust the modulation scheme to the channel conditions. ITU G.9903 
Amd1 specifies the G3 physical layer as normatively referenced in IEEE 1901.2, Clause 9.
The G3 MAC sublayer is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC standard CSMA/CA access method, quality 
of service, encryption, are the main features specified in ITU G.9903 Amd1. In addition, the 6LoWPAN 
convergence layer guarantees the support of IPv6 but also of authentication mechanisms during the 
network association phase which is totally managed by the lower layers. The usage which is made of 
RFC 4944 and RFC 6282 is fully described in ITU G.9903 Amd1.
NOTE	
If RFC 4944 specifies the compression of IPv6 (RFC 2460) and UDP (RFC 768) headers, IPv6 packets 
composed TCP (RFC 793) payloads and TCP plain headers are supported.
B.12.2	Data link data SAP
The interface to the higher layers consists in a set of generic primitives allowing the access to the lower 
layers in order to exchange data over the channel. The primitives are defined as follows:
