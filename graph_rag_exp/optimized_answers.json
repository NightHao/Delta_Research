    "What is D-LINK_READY.indication?": "The D-LINK_READY.indication is a communication message used to inform higher layer entities (HLE) about the status of a communication link. It serves as a notification mechanism to indicate whether a data link has been established or if there is no link. This indication is crucial for managing the communication link's status and ensuring that higher layers are aware of any changes.\n\nKey aspects of the D-LINK_READY.indication include:\n\n\n### 1. **Status Notification**\nIt provides information about the current status of the communication link, which can either be 'link established' or 'no link'.\n\n\n### 2. **Change Notification**\nThe indication is sent whenever there is a change in the communication link status. This ensures that higher layers are promptly informed of any transitions in the link's state.\n\n\n### 3. **Independence from Control Pilot Signal**\nThe values of the D-LINK_READY status are independent of the states of the control pilot signal, meaning that the indication focuses solely on the link status rather than other control signals.\n\n\n### 4. **Response to Link Loss**\nIf a data link was previously established and indicated to higher layers, any detected loss of the data link will trigger a D-LINK_READY.indication with a 'no link' status to inform higher layers of the disconnection.\n\n\n### 5. **Wake-up Detection**\nWhen the lower layers detect a data link after a wake-up event, they will send a D-LINK_READY.indication with a 'link established' status to the HLE, indicating that the link is active again.\n\n\n### 6. **Network Departure**\nWhen the low-layer communication module leaves the logical network, it will inform the HLE through a D-LINK_READY.indication with a 'no link' status, indicating that the link is no longer active.\n\nOverall, the D-LINK_READY.indication plays a critical role in maintaining communication link integrity and ensuring that higher layers are continuously updated about the link's status.",
    "What is D-LINK_TERMINATE.request?": "The D-LINK_TERMINATE.request is a message sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to request the termination of a data link. This request is directed towards the lower layers of a communication system, instructing them to terminate the existing data link. Upon receiving a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request, the communication node is required to leave the logical network within a specified time frame, referred to as TP_match_leave. Additionally, all parameters associated with the current link must be reset to their default values, and the status of the link should be changed to 'Unmatched'. This process effectively disconnects the communication node from the network and prepares it for potential future connections.",
    "What is D-LINK_ERROR.request?": "The D-LINK_ERROR.request is a communication protocol message used to manage the data link layer in a network, specifically in the context of electric vehicle (EV) communication systems. It is sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to instruct lower layers to terminate the current data link and restart the matching process. This request is typically used when there is a need to reset the communication link due to errors or issues that have arisen after the establishment of the data link.\n\nWhen a D-LINK_ERROR.request is received from the HLE, the EV's communication node is required to maintain its current state, exit the logical network, and change its matching state to 'unmatched'. This process ensures that any loss of communication after the data link has been established is managed appropriately by higher layers, which initiate the D-LINK_ERROR.request to address the issue.\n\nThe D-LINK_ERROR.request involves a control pilot transition through state E, which is part of the protocol's mechanism to handle errors and re-establish a stable communication link. This request is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the communication system, especially in scenarios where consistent and accurate data exchange is critical, such as in EV charging and communication with electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).",
    "What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?": "The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a message sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to request lower layers to enter a power-saving mode while maintaining the state as 'Matched'. This request is part of a communication protocol that involves transitioning to a low-power state without losing the established connection or network parameters.\n\nUpon receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is expected to switch to control pilot state X1 and may also switch its low-layer communication module into a low-power mode. Similarly, the Electric Vehicle (EV) should change to control pilot state Bx, with the option to unpower its low-layer communication module. In both cases, the logical network parameter set must be stored to ensure that the data link can be continued seamlessly after the sleeping phase.\n\nThe purpose of the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is to conserve energy by reducing power consumption in the communication modules while keeping the data link ready to resume normal operation without needing to re-establish the connection from scratch. This is particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining a continuous connection is important, but energy efficiency is also a priority."
