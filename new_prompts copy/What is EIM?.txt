IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
# Detailed Description of Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO‑0] in the ISO/IEC OSI Reference Model

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of the diagram labeled **“Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO-0] in the ISO/IEC OSI reference model.”** Although this figure is not a traditional “flowchart” (with decision diamonds or arrows depicting process steps), it provides a layered architectural view of how the ISO 15118 standards align with the classic ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. In the sections below, each labeled entity is identified, and its role and connections are described in detail.

---

## 2. Overall Structure of the Diagram

The figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):

1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑3 standard.  
2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** – Indicated by the “V2G standardized service primitive interface,” which bridges ISO 15118‑3 with the higher-layer protocols.  
3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑2 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO 15118‑1 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  

Within the big outer box labeled “Vehicle-to-Grid communication,” two standards are highlighted:
- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)
- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)

At the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.

---

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description

### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 1 Physical.”  
- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium—e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).

### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 2 Data link.”  
- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable “low-layer” communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 appear inside the “ISO 15118‑3” box. They are the core focus of “Part 3” of the ISO 15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized “pipe” for higher-layer messages.

### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface
- **Name in Diagram**: “V2G standardized service primitive interface.”  
- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO 15118‑2 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO 15118‑3.  
- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main “handshake” region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.

### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 3 Network.”  
- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).

### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 4 Transport.”  
- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO 15118‑2**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.

### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 5 Session.”  
- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO 15118‑2** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).

### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 6 Presentation.”  
- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer—handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.

### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 7 Application.”  
- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.

### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)
- **Name in Diagram**: “Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”  
- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of “V2G” communication from an OSI perspective—covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:
  1. **ISO 15118‑1** (General information and use-case definition)  
  2. **ISO 15118‑2** (Network and application protocol requirements)

  Where **ISO 15118‑1** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118‑2** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.

### 3.10 ISO 15118‑1
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑1.”  
- **Caption**: “General information and use-case definition.”  
- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (‑2 and ‑3).

### 3.11 ISO 15118‑2
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑2.”  
- **Caption**: “Network and application protocol requirements.”  
- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118‑1 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.

### 3.12 ISO 15118‑3
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑3.”  
- **Caption**: “Physical layer and Data link layer requirements.”  
- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118‑2) can function as intended.

---

## 4. Relationship and Connections

1. **ISO 15118‑3 → V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  
   - ISO 15118‑3 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.

2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface → ISO 15118‑2**  
   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO 15118‑2 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.

3. **ISO 15118‑2 → OSI Layers 3–7**  
   - ISO 15118‑2 “lives” across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.

4. **ISO 15118‑1 → Overall**  
   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO 15118‑1 supplies the conceptual building blocks—e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions—that shape the services needed in layers 1–7.

5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  
   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO 15118‑1 and ISO 15118‑2 is conceptually the V2G communication “stack,” reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO 15118‑3.

---

## 5. How the Diagram “Flows”
While not a classic procedural “flowchart,” the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:

1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  
2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  
3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  
4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3–7)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  

Each standard (ISO 15118‑1, ISO 15118‑2, and ISO 15118‑3) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers

- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO 15118‑3) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO 15118‑2), with ISO 15118‑1 providing conceptual underpinnings.  
- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  
- **Interoperability**: Each layer’s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor—covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.

---

**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO 15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Below is a detailed description of each labeled element in the schematic and how they interconnect. Although this figure is presented as a circuit diagram (rather than a traditional “flowchart”), the step-by-step structure below will help you follow the signal path and understand how each component relates to the others. This diagram shows how HomePlug Green PHY signals are injected in parallel (between the Control Pilot line and ground/earth) for communication between the EVSE and EV.

---

### 1. Entities Overview

1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)**  
   The left rectangular region represents the EVSE side. It provides the ±12 V, 1 kHz control pilot signal, measures voltage on the pilot line, injects and receives PLC (Power Line Communication) signals via a Green PHY modem, and references Earth (ground).

2. **EV (Electric Vehicle)**  
   The right rectangular region is the EV side. It also includes a Green PHY modem and supporting components for parallel injection and measurement of the control pilot signal (duty cycle and frequency). The EV’s contactors and internal circuitry ultimately use the pilot to detect charging states and enable communication.

3. **Oscillator ±12 V, 1 kHz (Key #2)**  
   Generates the low-frequency (1 kHz) PWM control pilot signal. This signal is crucial for basic control pilot functions prescribed by IEC 61851 (e.g., indicating EV readiness or maximum current availability).

4. **Pilot Contact (Key #3)**  
   The pilot contact is effectively the point where the EVSE’s control pilot line is physically connected to the corresponding pilot input on the EV side (through the charging cable and coupler).

5. **R1 1 k (on EVSE side)**  
   A series resistor (1 kΩ) connected to the oscillator output. It helps set the correct pilot voltage levels and limits current.

6. **C_S (on EVSE side)**  
   Often called the “control pilot capacitor” in IEC standards. It shapes the pilot signal to comply with specific requirements and influences the total capacitive behavior on the pilot line.

7. **Green PHY Modems (Key #5)**  
   Both the EVSE and EV sides include a Green PHY modem. These modems handle high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) communication on top of the pilot line. Each modem is shown in a dashed box on both sides (the rectangle labeled “5”).

8. **R_damp (Damping Resistor) and L (Inductor)**  
   Each side has an R_damp and L in series, forming part of the low-pass filter for the pilot signal (the LC network) and a high-pass path for the HomePlug Green PHY signals. R_damp prevents or limits resonance in the LC filter.

9. **C_PLC (Coupling Capacitors to the Green PHY Modem)**  
   These capacitors provide a high-frequency coupling path for the Green PHY signals from the pilot line into the modem, while isolating low-frequency or DC components.

10. **C_v (EV side)**  
   Defined in IEC documents, C_v is another capacitor related to the detection/measuring circuit inside the EV, usually affecting pilot line diagnostics or measurements.

11. **R2, R3, and S2 (EV side)**  
   — **R2 and R3**: Resistors on the EV side pilot circuitry, used for pilot line detection, current sensing, or dividing voltages for pilot sensing.  
   — **S2**: A switch (or contact) that can open/close for pilot line control or internal EV states.

12. **Voltage Measurement (Key #1)**  
   Indicates that the EVSE side monitors pilot voltage levels for compliance with control pilot specifications (e.g., states A, B, C in IEC 61851).

13. **Earth (ground) (Key #4)**  
   The reference earth or protective earth (PE). The high-frequency signal is injected between the pilot line and earth/ground. This ensures the HomePlug Green PHY signals have a proper return path.

14. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (Key #6)**  
   On the EV side, the duty cycle and frequency measurement block monitors the PWM characteristics of the pilot signal (i.e., the 1 kHz, ±12 V waveform) to interpret the EVSE’s indication of available current and other pilot states.

15. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   Shown as a dashed region, these might include filters, ESD protection, or EMC compliance parts. They should not degrade the HomePlug Green PHY signals beyond stated limits.

### 2. Step-by-Step Signal Flow and Connections

Even though this is a circuit schematic rather than a traditional flowchart, we can describe how signals traverse or how each function occurs in succession:

1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  
   - The **oscillator (±12 V, 1 kHz)** produces the control pilot waveform.  
   - The pilot waveform goes through **R1 (1 kΩ)** and **C_S**, shaping the signal and ensuring correct amplitude as per IEC requirements.

2. **Pilot Line Connection to Green PHY Modem (EVSE side)**  
   - The **pilot line** is also branched through the **LC filter** formed by **L** (inductor) and **R_damp** (damping resistor) to the **C_PLC** capacitor.  
   - **C_PLC** feeds the **Green PHY modem**, allowing high-frequency components (the HPGP signal) to pass to/from the modem but blocking the lower-frequency 1 kHz pilot wave from saturating the modem.

3. **Voltage Measurement (EVSE side)**  
   - The EVSE monitors the pilot voltage (labeled Key #1) to verify pilot states, detect EV presence, and measure any duty cycle references required by the standard.

4. **Pilot Contact (Connector) Between EVSE and EV (Key #3)**  
   - The pilot line physically transitions from the EVSE circuit to the EV circuit at the **pilot contact**. This is typically inside the charging cable and coupler.

5. **Green PHY Parallel Injection Path to Earth (EV Side)**  
   - On reaching the EV side, the pilot line splits:  
     - One path continues into the EV’s measurement and pilot control logic (through R3, R2, and possibly S2).  
     - Another path branches through another LC filter stage (**L**, **R_damp**, **C_PLC**) to the **Green PHY modem** on the EV side. The parallel injection is again between the pilot line and **earth/ground**.  
   - The diode shown in the pilot line (on the EV side) can be part of the standard pilot detection or protective circuitry.

6. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (EV side, Key #6)**  
   - The EV needs to interpret the EVSE’s PWM signal to understand the available current or states (A, B, C, etc.). Thus, there is a block that directly measures the pilot’s duty cycle and frequency once it has passed through the EV’s front-end components.

7. **S2 (EV side switch)**  
   - **S2** may engage or disengage certain parts of the EV’s pilot circuitry, depending on the EV’s state (e.g., if the EV is ready to charge or certain fault conditions). When closed, the pilot circuit is fully connected; when open, the pilot circuit is interrupted.

8. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   - Finally, any **additional PLC coupling** components (EMC filters, ESD protection, etc.) are placed so they do not adversely affect the high-frequency Green PHY signals or the low-frequency pilot signal. They must maintain compliance with the emission and immunity constraints (A.10 EMC requirements and others cited in ISO 15118-3).

---

### 3. Relationship and Purpose of Each Section

- **Low-Frequency Pilot Signal Path (1 kHz)**  
  Passes through R1, C_S, the pilot contact, R2, R3, and S2 (when closed). The EVSE and EV measure this pilot for verifying connection status, charging states, and maximum current availability.

- **High-Frequency Communication Path (HomePlug Green PHY)**  
  Injected in parallel to earth at both the EVSE and EV sides via the LC filters (L, R_damp, and C_PLC). These filters isolate the 1 kHz pilot wave from the modem but allow the higher-frequency data signals to travel between the two Green PHY modems.

- **Filtering and EMC Considerations**  
  Inductors, damping resistors, and capacitors create low-pass filtering for pilot signals and high-pass filtering for the PLC signals. This design ensures that high-frequency data does not overly distort the control pilot, while the pilot line remains within standard requirements (IEC 61851, ISO 15118-3, etc.).

- **Measurement Points**  
  Key #1 (voltage measurement) and Key #6 (duty cycle/frequency measurement) denote where the EVSE and EV measure the pilot signal. In each case, there may be a low-pass filter recommended to remove the high-frequency components from the measurement path (per the notes in ISO 15118-3).

---

### 4. Summary

Figure A.10 demonstrates an example implementation of “parallel injection” for HomePlug Green PHY signals onto the control pilot line:

- The **EVSE** supplies the main pilot signal via an oscillator and monitors pilot voltage.  
- **Parallel injection** ensures both the EVSE and EV couple the high-frequency Green PHY signals between the pilot and ground.  
- **Low-pass + high-pass filtering** (with L, R_damp, and capacitors) allows the 1 kHz pilot control signal to pass unimpeded while at the same time guiding the high-frequency Green PHY data to each modem.  
- **Duty-cycle/frequency measurements** are taken by both sides (the EVSE monitors the raw pilot voltage; the EV monitors duty cycle) while the high-frequency data is superimposed.  

Through these components and connections, the system meets the dual requirements of standard pilot signaling (for charging states) and HomePlug Green PHY communication (for vehicle-to-grid data exchange) on the same control pilot conductor.

Image Description for Figure A.13:
# Detailed Description of Figure A.13 – Implementation Example with a HomePlug Green PHY Coupling Transformer

Below is a detailed, step-by-step description of the schematic labeled “Figure A.13 — Implementation example with a HomePlug Green PHY coupling transformer.” Although the figure is presented more like a circuit schematic than a traditional flowchart, this explanation follows each “path” and notes all components to help engineers quickly understand how signals and connections are arranged.  

---

## 1. Overall Schematic Overview

The diagram shows two main sections:

1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) side** (left block)  
2. **EV (Electric Vehicle) side** (right block)  

These two blocks are connected via the **control pilot line** and share the same protective earth/ground reference. Within each block, various components provide:

- The generation and measurement of the PWM “control pilot” signal (nominal ±12 V at 1 kHz).  
- The coupling of high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY signals through a dedicated transformer and capacitors.  
- Protective and filtering elements (resistors, inductors, damping networks, diodes).  

The high-level purpose is to **inject** and **receive** HomePlug Green PHY communication signals over the control pilot while simultaneously maintaining the standard EVSE–EV PWM control signal (1 kHz) and capturing duty-cycle and amplitude measurements.

---

## 2. Entities (Components) and Their Roles

Below is a list of the labeled entities from the figure and a short description of each:

1. **Amplitude/state measurement** (labeled “1”)  
   - Measures the voltage amplitude of the pilot signal, helping determine EV connection state and diagnostic information.

2. **Oscillator ±12 V 1 kHz** (labeled “2”)  
   - The fundamental PWM generator that provides the control pilot signal (±12 V) at 1 kHz on the EVSE side.

3. **PLC chipset** (labeled “3”)  
   - The HomePlug Green PHY powerline communication module. It couples the data signal onto the control pilot line through a transformer and filter network.

4. **Charge cord Cc < 1 500 pF** (labeled “4”)  
   - Indicates the total parasitic capacitance of the charging cord connecting the EVSE pilot line to the EV’s inlet. It must be below 1,500 pF.

5. **Dutycycle measurement** (labeled “5”)  
   - A measurement block that evaluates the PWM duty cycle on the EV side. The EV uses this for determining the available current and state of charge control.

6. **Implementation example with a HomePlug Green PHY coupling transformer** (text at the bottom of the diagram) and **Figure A.13**  
   - Indicates that this schematic is the official example of how to implement a HomePlug Green PHY coupling onto the control pilot line.

7. **R1, R2, R3**  
   - Resistors necessary to meet IEC 61851 or ISO 15118 pilot wiring guidelines (e.g., R1 on the EVSE side, R2 & R3 inside the EV circuit). They help set pilot voltages and sense states.

8. **L** (shown on both EVSE and EV as part of an LC filter with “RDamp”)  
   - An inductor for filtering and shaping the communication and pilot signals. Often used to suppress high-frequency noise.

9. **S2**  
   - A switching element on the EV side. It may represent enable/disable or grounding states as required by the control pilot standard (IEC 61851).

10. **RDamp**  
    - A damping resistor (220 Ω in the example) placed in series with the inductor L. It helps control or damp resonances in the pilot line.

11. **Cs**  
    - A capacitor on the EVSE side that, together with R1 and other passive components, forms part of the pilot shaping and filtering network.

12. **CM**  
    - A small coupling capacitor (100 pF in the example) used for noise filtering or common-mode coupling.

13. **RM**  
    - A resistor in the megaohm-to-kilohm range (shown as 10 kΩ in the example). Often used to form a referencing path for measuring pilot or for protection.

14. **2× CPLC**  
    - Two coupling capacitors (each about 1.35 nF in the example) that convey the high-frequency communication signals from the PLC chipset transformer out to, or in from, the pilot line—while blocking the low-frequency (1 kHz) PWM from interfering directly with the PLC chipset.

15. **CV**  
    - Another capacitor (labeled “[IEC-1]” in the example table) on the EV side for pilot signal conditioning or filtering.

16. **D**  
    - A diode in the EV circuit. It can be for polarity protection or controlling certain pilot states (e.g., releasing pilot line if there is an error).

17. **EVSE**  
    - The electric vehicle supply equipment block containing the control pilot generation, measurement, and the PLC modem coupling network (left-hand block).

18. **EV**  
    - The electric vehicle block containing the pilot detection circuit, duty cycle measurement, and the complementary PLC modem coupling (right-hand block).

---

## 3. Signal Paths and Connections

Although not a classic “flowchart,” the diagram displays how signals flow between the EVSE and EV via the pilot line. The main paths are:

1. **Pilot PWM Path (Low-Frequency: 1 kHz)**  
   - On the **EVSE side**, the ±12 V, 1 kHz oscillator (2) injects the control pilot signal.  
   - The pilot amplitude is monitored by the **amplitude/state measurement** (1) in the EVSE to detect EV presence and state transitions.  
   - On the **EV side**, the duty-cycle measurement (5) monitors the arriving PWM for the pilot signal’s high/low levels. The EV can switch S2 or adjust internal connections to signal different EV states (e.g., charging, ventilation required, etc.).  
   - **R1, R2, R3, Cs, CV, CM, and RM** adjust or sense the pilot line level and ensure pilot compliance to IEC 61851-1.

2. **HomePlug Green PHY Data Path (High-Frequency: ~1.8 MHz–30 MHz)**  
   - **PLC chipset (3)** on the EVSE side drives/receives high-frequency signals through a **coupling transformer** and the pair of capacitors **(2× CPLC)**.  
   - The communication signals combine with the pilot line through these coupling capacitors but do not substantially affect the 1 kHz pilot thanks to filtering by the inductor **L**, resistors **RDamp**, and other high-frequency–blocking elements.  
   - At the **EV side**, the high-frequency PLC signal also couples via **2× CPLC** and a similar **transformer** arrangement.  
   - **L** (the inductor) and **RDamp** components on both sides help prevent large resonance or undesired signal reflection.  
   - The diode **D** can protect the EV from any reversed or high-voltage events.  

3. **Charge Cord Consideration**  
   - The **charge cord Cc < 1 500 pF** (4) is shown as the cable parasitic capacitance. Keeping this capacitance low is necessary to preserve signal integrity for both the pilot PWM and high-frequency PLC communication.

4. **Ground/Earth Reference**  
   - Both EVSE and EV are referenced to a common ground for safety and measurement consistency.  
   - The standard requires that the pilot line operate with known references for amplitude measurement and duty cycle detection.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Function (Interpretation)

To interpret this schematic in a stepwise “flow,” consider the main functionality:

1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  
   a. The oscillator (2) outputs a ±12 V, 1 kHz PWM.  
   b. This signal passes through R1, Cs, and other pilot-conditioning components.  
   c. The **amplitude/state measurement** (1) on the EVSE side observes the pilot voltage amplitude to detect EV presence.  

2. **Pilot Signal Transmission via Control Pilot**  
   a. The pilot line travels through the charge cord.  
   b. **2× CPLC** capacitors on each side couple the broadband PLC signals but appear high-impedance at low frequency (1 kHz), so the pilot is only mildly affected.  
   c. The pilot line arrives at the EV’s circuit with R2, R3, etc., that set or detect the pilot level.  

3. **Pilot Signal Detection (EV side)**  
   a. The duty cycle measurement (5) block measures the incoming PWM signal.  
   b. S2 and the diode (D) can switch states according to standard charging protocols (e.g., controlling whether the EV is ready for charging, demands ventilation, etc.).  

4. **HomePlug Green PHY Communication**  
   a. The EVSE’s PLC chipset (3) injects high-frequency signals through a coupling transformer and **2× CPLC**.  
   b. The EV’s PLC circuitry also couples through an identical transformer and capacitor arrangement.  
   c. Inductor (L) and RDamp on both sides help shape or attenuate high-frequency noise.  
   d. This ensures data can flow between EVSE and EV over the same pilot line used for PWM.  

By combining these steps, the system achieves **both** standard pilot control (per IEC 61851-1) **and** high-frequency data communication (per ISO 15118 / HomePlug Green PHY).

---

## 5. Additional Notes for Engineers

- **Component Values**:  
  Table A.12 of the standard gives typical component values (e.g., L = 220 µH, RDamp = 220 Ω, CPLC = 1.35 nF, etc.). Actual values depend on the specific PLC chipset design and compliance with ISO 15118-3 and IEC 61851.  

- **50 Ω Considerations**:  
  Many measurement recommendations in ISO 15118-3 specify a 50 Ω environment (e.g., for spectrum analyzers, for measuring PSD). The design must ensure consistent 50 Ω terminations and minimal insertion loss in the PLC frequency range.

- **PWM Integrity**:  
  The pilot’s ±12 V amplitude and shape must not be distorted beyond specification. This includes ensuring the high-frequency coupling doesn’t degrade the 1 kHz pilot signal or the EV’s ability to measure duty cycle accurately.

- **Safety**:  
  Elements like the diode (D) and the resistor networks protect against transient conditions and ensure no unsafe voltages appear on the pilot line.

---

## 6. Summary

Figure A.13 illustrates a complete example of how to **inject HomePlug Green PHY signals** onto the **control pilot** between EVSE and EV, while still respecting the **IEC 61851** pilot requirements (±12 V at 1 kHz) and enabling **iso15118** high-level communication. Each component shown is carefully chosen to filter, protect, or measure signals at both low (1 kHz pilot) and high (1.8–30 MHz) frequencies, ensuring proper broadband communication and standard-compliant PWM pilot functionality.

For the implementation example in Figure A.13, the component values defined in Table A.12 should be applied. (sibling of Text 4)

Figure B.2 — Coupling circuit for G3 technology on pilot wire (sibling of Text 4)

Image Description for Figure B.2:
**# Detailed Description of Figure B.2 — Coupling Circuit for G3 Technology on Pilot Wire**

Below is a step-by-step, detailed explanation of the schematic shown in “Figure B.2 — Coupling circuit for G3 technology on pilot wire.” This diagram illustrates how the high-frequency G3-PLC (IEEE 1901.2) communication signals are coupled to the control pilot line between an EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) and an EV (Electric Vehicle). Although it is presented more like a circuit diagram than a traditional “flow chart,” the following description walks through each component and path in order.

---

## 1. Diagram Overview

- The diagram shows two main blocks labeled:
  1. **modem on EVSE** (on the left side)  
  2. **modem on EV** (on the right side)  

- Between these two sides, there is a **pilot line** that incorporates inductors (Lx1, Lx2), resistors (Rx1, Rx2), coupling capacitors (Cx1, Cx2, Cx3, Cx4), and other passive components.  
- Additional standard pilot-circuit elements (R1, C1, R2, R3, S1, etc.) are shown but described as “indicated for information only” in the standard.  
- The cable assembly between the EVSE and EV is represented as **T2**, with an additional coupler T7 in the middle.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Signal/Circuit Path Description

Because this diagram is a coupling circuit rather than a traditional directional “flow chart,” the best way to describe its “flow” is to trace how a G3-PLC signal travels between the modems:

1. **AC Pilot Supply and Pilot Reference (Left Most Side)**  
   - A pilot signal or supply is connected through **R1 (1 kΩ)**.  
   - **C1 (300 pF)** goes from the pilot conductor to ground (node “0”) for noise filtering.  

2. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EVSE Side (Lx1 & Rx1)**  
   - After leaving R1/C1, the pilot line passes through **Lx1 (1 000 µH)** in series with **Rx1 (680 Ω)**.  
   - These form the mandatory high-frequency blocking or “choke” to keep the pilot circuit from shunting all high-frequency energy to ground.

3. **Coupling to EVSE Modem (Block “1”)**  
   - The pilot line node (between Lx1/Rx1 and T2/T7) goes to two coupling capacitors feeding the EVSE modem:  
     - **Cx3 (< 500 pF)** → Possibly connected toward the modem **In** pin, with resistor **Rx5 (> 10 kΩ)** referencing input impedance to ground.  
     - **Cx1 (500 pF)** → Possibly connected toward the modem **Out** pin, with resistor **Rx3 (1 kΩ)** as the modem’s internal source resistor for the HF signal.  
   - These capacitors pass the high-frequency G3-PLC signals but block low-frequency or DC pilot currents.

4. **Cable Assembly and Center Coupling (T2 and T7)**  
   - **T2** is the physical cable from EVSE to EV, carrying the pilot conductor (and possibly other conductors).  
   - **T7** is an in-line coupling element or test point. The standard simply shows T7 in the path, which might be used for measurement or for additional filtering.

5. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EV Side (Lx2 & Rx2)**  
   - On the vehicle side, the pilot conductor is again routed through another set of inductor and resistor: **Lx2 (1 000 µH)** and **Rx2 (680 Ω)**.  
   - As on the EVSE side, Lx2 and Rx2 ensure that the EV’s internal pilot circuitry does not excessively load or short out the PLC signal.

6. **EV Standard Pilot Connection (C2b, R2, R3, S1)**  
   - The figure shows some typical pilot-circuit resistors **R2 (2.7 kΩ)**, **R3 (1.3 kΩ)**, and switch **S1**. These are part of the standard IEC 61851-1 pilot function for controlling and detecting EV presence or charging states.  
   - A capacitor **C2b (1 n? )** may also appear, used for smoothing or filtering within the EV’s pilot logic.  

7. **Coupling to EV Modem (Block “2”)**  
   - Similar to the EVSE side, the EV modem connects to the pilot line through coupling capacitors and limiting resistors:  
     - **Cx2 (500 pF)** is the main coupling capacitor for the high-frequency transmit/receive path.  
     - **Rx4 (1 kΩ)** is the internal source/limiting resistor.  
     - **Cx4 (< 500 pF)** could be the receive filter capacitor.  
     - **Rx6 (> 10 kΩ)** is again an optional high-value input impedance resistor to ground.  

8. **Signal Path for G3-PLC**  
   - In essence, the G3-PLC signal travels from the EVSE modem (left block) → coupling capacitors (Cx1/Cx3) → pilot line through Lx1 + Rx1 → T2/T7 → Lx2 + Rx2 → coupling capacitors (Cx2/Cx4) → EV modem (right block).  
   - The mandatory values of Lx1, Lx2 (each 1 000 µH), Rx1, Rx2 (each 680 Ω), and Cx1, Cx2 (each 500 pF) are specified to ensure consistent attenuation and adequate coupling across a wide frequency range, while also meeting EMC requirements.

## 4. Connections and Relationships

- **Pilot Wire Core**: The pilot wire is the main conductor bridging EVSE and EV. It carries both the standard PWM pilot signal (per IEC 61851-1) and now the superimposed high-frequency G3-PLC signals.
- **High-Frequency Isolation**:  
  - Lx1, Rx1, Lx2, Rx2 form the series choke and damping sections.  
  - These prevent the pilot line’s normal low-frequency control signal from interfering with G3-PLC, and vice versa.
- **Coupling Capacitors**:  
  - Cx1, Cx2 provide the primary path for injecting/extracting high-frequency signals to/from the pilot line.  
  - Cx3, Cx4 are secondary capacitors for filtering or for the input side of the modem.
- **Resistive Networks**:  
  - Rx3, Rx4 are the output resistors from the modem perspective (limiting voltage amplitude).  
  - Rx5, Rx6 are optional high-value input resistors to ground or to the reference inside the modem, allowing minimal loading.  
- **Standard Pilot Components**:  
  - R1, C1, R2, R3, and S1 are from IEC 61851-1 pilot circuit definition, ensuring safe operation and standardized detection of charge states. They are “informational” in this figure but included so that engineers see the complete interplay between pilot function and PLC signals.

---

## 5. Additional Notes from the Standard

1. **Signal Level Requirements**  
   - Per ISO 15118-3 and IEEE 1901.2 references, the PLC signal on the pilot wire is limited to 0.5 V RMS maximum (to avoid interference with pilot PWM) and at least 0.2 V RMS to ensure reliable communication.

2. **Mandatory Coupling Values**  
   - Inductors:  
     - Lx1, Lx2 = 1 000 µH (each)  
   - Resistors:  
     - Rx1, Rx2 ≈ 680 Ω (each)  
     - Rx3, Rx4 ≈ 1 kΩ (internal source)  
     - Rx5, Rx6 > 10 kΩ (optional input)  
   - Capacitors:  
     - Cx1, Cx2 = 500 pF  
     - Cx3, Cx4 < 500 pF (exact value can vary)  

3. **EMC Compliance**  
   - Clause B.10 in ISO 15118-3 references EMC requirements from IEEE 1901.2. Additional filtering or decoupling elements can be added to ensure no more than 0.5 V RMS on the pilot-based PWM signal.

4. **Cable Assembly (T2)**  
   - T2 denotes the physical link between EVSE and EV. The standard clarifies that cable/detachable connectors must accommodate the pilot line for both the low-frequency PWM and the high-frequency G3-PLC signals.

---

## 6. Practical Engineering Takeaways

1. **Must-Have Components**:  
   - Ensure the presence of inductors (Lx1, Lx2) and the coupling capacitors (Cx1, Cx2) per the mandatory values if implementing G3 technology on the pilot line.  
2. **In-Modem Resistance**:  
   - The 1 kΩ resistors (Rx3, Rx4) help maintain consistent pilot-wire voltage amplitude for the G3 signals.  
3. **EMC & Filtering**:  
   - Additional filtering on power lines (e.g., at the EVSE side) might be necessary in noisy environments.  
4. **Pilot Circuit**:  
   - R1, R2, R3, C1, and S1 remain part of basic pilot architecture per IEC 61851-1:2010 Annex A.

### In Summary

Figure B.2 shows how a G3-PLC modem on both the EVSE (block “1”) and the EV (block “2”) couples their high-frequency communication signals onto the same pilot wire used for the standard IEC 61851-1 charging control. Key components—**Lx1, Lx2, Rx1, Rx2, Cx1, Cx2**—protect the pilot circuit from unwanted loading and allow reliable PLC signal transmission. The resistor-capacitor networks and optional additional filters ensure the PLC signal stays within required amplitude limits (0.2–0.5 V RMS) while still leaving the pilot function intact.

Engineers referencing this figure should pay special attention to the mandatory component values and overall pilot-circuit layout, verifying that each device (EVSE and EV) implements these coupling elements as specified by ISO 15118-3, Annex B, and IEEE 1901.2 to ensure interoperability and EMC compliance.

## Figure A.10 — Implementation of Parallel Injection

Below is a detailed description of each labeled element in the schematic and how they interconnect. Although this figure is presented as a circuit diagram (rather than a traditional “flowchart”), the step-by-step structure below will help you follow the signal path and understand how each component relates to the others. This diagram shows how HomePlug Green PHY signals are injected in parallel (between the Control Pilot line and ground/earth) for communication between the EVSE and EV.

---

### 1. Entities Overview

1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)**  
   The left rectangular region represents the EVSE side. It provides the ±12 V, 1 kHz control pilot signal, measures voltage on the pilot line, injects and receives PLC (Power Line Communication) signals via a Green PHY modem, and references Earth (ground).

2. **EV (Electric Vehicle)**  
   The right rectangular region is the EV side. It also includes a Green PHY modem and supporting components for parallel injection and measurement of the control pilot signal (duty cycle and frequency). The EV’s contactors and internal circuitry ultimately use the pilot to detect charging states and enable communication.

3. **Oscillator ±12 V, 1 kHz (Key #2)**  
   Generates the low-frequency (1 kHz) PWM control pilot signal. This signal is crucial for basic control pilot functions prescribed by IEC 61851 (e.g., indicating EV readiness or maximum current availability).

4. **Pilot Contact (Key #3)**  
   The pilot contact is effectively the point where the EVSE’s control pilot line is physically connected to the corresponding pilot input on the EV side (through the charging cable and coupler).

5. **R1 1 k (on EVSE side)**  
   A series resistor (1 kΩ) connected to the oscillator output. It helps set the correct pilot voltage levels and limits current.

6. **C_S (on EVSE side)**  
   Often called the “control pilot capacitor” in IEC standards. It shapes the pilot signal to comply with specific requirements and influences the total capacitive behavior on the pilot line.

7. **Green PHY Modems (Key #5)**  
   Both the EVSE and EV sides include a Green PHY modem. These modems handle high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) communication on top of the pilot line. Each modem is shown in a dashed box on both sides (the rectangle labeled “5”).

8. **R_damp (Damping Resistor) and L (Inductor)**  
   Each side has an R_damp and L in series, forming part of the low-pass filter for the pilot signal (the LC network) and a high-pass path for the HomePlug Green PHY signals. R_damp prevents or limits resonance in the LC filter.

9. **C_PLC (Coupling Capacitors to the Green PHY Modem)**  
   These capacitors provide a high-frequency coupling path for the Green PHY signals from the pilot line into the modem, while isolating low-frequency or DC components.

10. **C_v (EV side)**  
   Defined in IEC documents, C_v is another capacitor related to the detection/measuring circuit inside the EV, usually affecting pilot line diagnostics or measurements.

11. **R2, R3, and S2 (EV side)**  
   — **R2 and R3**: Resistors on the EV side pilot circuitry, used for pilot line detection, current sensing, or dividing voltages for pilot sensing.  
   — **S2**: A switch (or contact) that can open/close for pilot line control or internal EV states.

12. **Voltage Measurement (Key #1)**  
   Indicates that the EVSE side monitors pilot voltage levels for compliance with control pilot specifications (e.g., states A, B, C in IEC 61851).

13. **Earth (ground) (Key #4)**  
   The reference earth or protective earth (PE). The high-frequency signal is injected between the pilot line and earth/ground. This ensures the HomePlug Green PHY signals have a proper return path.

14. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (Key #6)**  
   On the EV side, the duty cycle and frequency measurement block monitors the PWM characteristics of the pilot signal (i.e., the 1 kHz, ±12 V waveform) to interpret the EVSE’s indication of available current and other pilot states.

15. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   Shown as a dashed region, these might include filters, ESD protection, or EMC compliance parts. They should not degrade the HomePlug Green PHY signals beyond stated limits.

### 2. Step-by-Step Signal Flow and Connections

Even though this is a circuit schematic rather than a traditional flowchart, we can describe how signals traverse or how each function occurs in succession:

1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  
   - The **oscillator (±12 V, 1 kHz)** produces the control pilot waveform.  
   - The pilot waveform goes through **R1 (1 kΩ)** and **C_S**, shaping the signal and ensuring correct amplitude as per IEC requirements.

2. **Pilot Line Connection to Green PHY Modem (EVSE side)**  
   - The **pilot line** is also branched through the **LC filter** formed by **L** (inductor) and **R_damp** (damping resistor) to the **C_PLC** capacitor.  
   - **C_PLC** feeds the **Green PHY modem**, allowing high-frequency components (the HPGP signal) to pass to/from the modem but blocking the lower-frequency 1 kHz pilot wave from saturating the modem.

3. **Voltage Measurement (EVSE side)**  
   - The EVSE monitors the pilot voltage (labeled Key #1) to verify pilot states, detect EV presence, and measure any duty cycle references required by the standard.

4. **Pilot Contact (Connector) Between EVSE and EV (Key #3)**  
   - The pilot line physically transitions from the EVSE circuit to the EV circuit at the **pilot contact**. This is typically inside the charging cable and coupler.

5. **Green PHY Parallel Injection Path to Earth (EV Side)**  
   - On reaching the EV side, the pilot line splits:  
     - One path continues into the EV’s measurement and pilot control logic (through R3, R2, and possibly S2).  
     - Another path branches through another LC filter stage (**L**, **R_damp**, **C_PLC**) to the **Green PHY modem** on the EV side. The parallel injection is again between the pilot line and **earth/ground**.  
   - The diode shown in the pilot line (on the EV side) can be part of the standard pilot detection or protective circuitry.

6. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (EV side, Key #6)**  
   - The EV needs to interpret the EVSE’s PWM signal to understand the available current or states (A, B, C, etc.). Thus, there is a block that directly measures the pilot’s duty cycle and frequency once it has passed through the EV’s front-end components.

7. **S2 (EV side switch)**  
   - **S2** may engage or disengage certain parts of the EV’s pilot circuitry, depending on the EV’s state (e.g., if the EV is ready to charge or certain fault conditions). When closed, the pilot circuit is fully connected; when open, the pilot circuit is interrupted.

8. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   - Finally, any **additional PLC coupling** components (EMC filters, ESD protection, etc.) are placed so they do not adversely affect the high-frequency Green PHY signals or the low-frequency pilot signal. They must maintain compliance with the emission and immunity constraints (A.10 EMC requirements and others cited in ISO 15118-3).

---

### 3. Relationship and Purpose of Each Section

- **Low-Frequency Pilot Signal Path (1 kHz)**  
  Passes through R1, C_S, the pilot contact, R2, R3, and S2 (when closed). The EVSE and EV measure this pilot for verifying connection status, charging states, and maximum current availability.

- **High-Frequency Communication Path (HomePlug Green PHY)**  
  Injected in parallel to earth at both the EVSE and EV sides via the LC filters (L, R_damp, and C_PLC). These filters isolate the 1 kHz pilot wave from the modem but allow the higher-frequency data signals to travel between the two Green PHY modems.

- **Filtering and EMC Considerations**  
  Inductors, damping resistors, and capacitors create low-pass filtering for pilot signals and high-pass filtering for the PLC signals. This design ensures that high-frequency data does not overly distort the control pilot, while the pilot line remains within standard requirements (IEC 61851, ISO 15118-3, etc.).

- **Measurement Points**  
  Key #1 (voltage measurement) and Key #6 (duty cycle/frequency measurement) denote where the EVSE and EV measure the pilot signal. In each case, there may be a low-pass filter recommended to remove the high-frequency components from the measurement path (per the notes in ISO 15118-3).

### 4. Summary

Figure A.10 demonstrates an example implementation of “parallel injection” for HomePlug Green PHY signals onto the control pilot line:

- The **EVSE** supplies the main pilot signal via an oscillator and monitors pilot voltage.  
- **Parallel injection** ensures both the EVSE and EV couple the high-frequency Green PHY signals between the pilot and ground.  
- **Low-pass + high-pass filtering** (with L, R_damp, and capacitors) allows the 1 kHz pilot control signal to pass unimpeded while at the same time guiding the high-frequency Green PHY data to each modem.  
- **Duty-cycle/frequency measurements** are taken by both sides (the EVSE monitors the raw pilot voltage; the EV monitors duty cycle) while the high-frequency data is superimposed.  

Through these components and connections, the system meets the dual requirements of standard pilot signaling (for charging states) and HomePlug Green PHY communication (for vehicle-to-grid data exchange) on the same control pilot conductor.

Image Description for Figure A.13:
# Detailed Description of Figure A.13 – Implementation Example with a HomePlug Green PHY Coupling Transformer

Below is a detailed, step-by-step description of the schematic labeled “Figure A.13 — Implementation example with a HomePlug Green PHY coupling transformer.” Although the figure is presented more like a circuit schematic than a traditional flowchart, this explanation follows each “path” and notes all components to help engineers quickly understand how signals and connections are arranged.  

---

## 1. Overall Schematic Overview

The diagram shows two main sections:

1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) side** (left block)  
2. **EV (Electric Vehicle) side** (right block)  

These two blocks are connected via the **control pilot line** and share the same protective earth/ground reference. Within each block, various components provide:

- The generation and measurement of the PWM “control pilot” signal (nominal ±12 V at 1 kHz).  
- The coupling of high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY signals through a dedicated transformer and capacitors.  
- Protective and filtering elements (resistors, inductors, damping networks, diodes).  

The high-level purpose is to **inject** and **receive** HomePlug Green PHY communication signals over the control pilot while simultaneously maintaining the standard EVSE–EV PWM control signal (1 kHz) and capturing duty-cycle and amplitude measurements.

---

## 2. Entities (Components) and Their Roles

Below is a list of the labeled entities from the figure and a short description of each:

1. **Amplitude/state measurement** (labeled “1”)  
   - Measures the voltage amplitude of the pilot signal, helping determine EV connection state and diagnostic information.

2. **Oscillator ±12 V 1 kHz** (labeled “2”)  
   - The fundamental PWM generator that provides the control pilot signal (±12 V) at 1 kHz on the EVSE side.

3. **PLC chipset** (labeled “3”)  
   - The HomePlug Green PHY powerline communication module. It couples the data signal onto the control pilot line through a transformer and filter network.

4. **Charge cord Cc < 1 500 pF** (labeled “4”)  
   - Indicates the total parasitic capacitance of the charging cord connecting the EVSE pilot line to the EV’s inlet. It must be below 1,500 pF.

5. **Dutycycle measurement** (labeled “5”)  
   - A measurement block that evaluates the PWM duty cycle on the EV side. The EV uses this for determining the available current and state of charge control.

6. **Implementation example with a HomePlug Green PHY coupling transformer** (text at the bottom of the diagram) and **Figure A.13**  
   - Indicates that this schematic is the official example of how to implement a HomePlug Green PHY coupling onto the control pilot line.

7. **R1, R2, R3**  
   - Resistors necessary to meet IEC 61851 or ISO 15118 pilot wiring guidelines (e.g., R1 on the EVSE side, R2 & R3 inside the EV circuit). They help set pilot voltages and sense states.

8. **L** (shown on both EVSE and EV as part of an LC filter with “RDamp”)  
   - An inductor for filtering and shaping the communication and pilot signals. Often used to suppress high-frequency noise.

9. **S2**  
   - A switching element on the EV side. It may represent enable/disable or grounding states as required by the control pilot standard (IEC 61851).

10. **RDamp**  
    - A damping resistor (220 Ω in the example) placed in series with the inductor L. It helps control or damp resonances in the pilot line.

11. **Cs**  
    - A capacitor on the EVSE side that, together with R1 and other passive components, forms part of the pilot shaping and filtering network.

12. **CM**  
    - A small coupling capacitor (100 pF in the example) used for noise filtering or common-mode coupling.

13. **RM**  
    - A resistor in the megaohm-to-kilohm range (shown as 10 kΩ in the example). Often used to form a referencing path for measuring pilot or for protection.

14. **2× CPLC**  
    - Two coupling capacitors (each about 1.35 nF in the example) that convey the high-frequency communication signals from the PLC chipset transformer out to, or in from, the pilot line—while blocking the low-frequency (1 kHz) PWM from interfering directly with the PLC chipset.

15. **CV**  
    - Another capacitor (labeled “[IEC-1]” in the example table) on the EV side for pilot signal conditioning or filtering.

16. **D**  
    - A diode in the EV circuit. It can be for polarity protection or controlling certain pilot states (e.g., releasing pilot line if there is an error).

17. **EVSE**  
    - The electric vehicle supply equipment block containing the control pilot generation, measurement, and the PLC modem coupling network (left-hand block).

18. **EV**  
    - The electric vehicle block containing the pilot detection circuit, duty cycle measurement, and the complementary PLC modem coupling (right-hand block).

---

## 3. Signal Paths and Connections

Although not a classic “flowchart,” the diagram displays how signals flow between the EVSE and EV via the pilot line. The main paths are:

1. **Pilot PWM Path (Low-Frequency: 1 kHz)**  
   - On the **EVSE side**, the ±12 V, 1 kHz oscillator (2) injects the control pilot signal.  
   - The pilot amplitude is monitored by the **amplitude/state measurement** (1) in the EVSE to detect EV presence and state transitions.  
   - On the **EV side**, the duty-cycle measurement (5) monitors the arriving PWM for the pilot signal’s high/low levels. The EV can switch S2 or adjust internal connections to signal different EV states (e.g., charging, ventilation required, etc.).  
   - **R1, R2, R3, Cs, CV, CM, and RM** adjust or sense the pilot line level and ensure pilot compliance to IEC 61851-1.

2. **HomePlug Green PHY Data Path (High-Frequency: ~1.8 MHz–30 MHz)**  
   - **PLC chipset (3)** on the EVSE side drives/receives high-frequency signals through a **coupling transformer** and the pair of capacitors **(2× CPLC)**.  
   - The communication signals combine with the pilot line through these coupling capacitors but do not substantially affect the 1 kHz pilot thanks to filtering by the inductor **L**, resistors **RDamp**, and other high-frequency–blocking elements.  
   - At the **EV side**, the high-frequency PLC signal also couples via **2× CPLC** and a similar **transformer** arrangement.  
   - **L** (the inductor) and **RDamp** components on both sides help prevent large resonance or undesired signal reflection.  
   - The diode **D** can protect the EV from any reversed or high-voltage events.  

3. **Charge Cord Consideration**  
   - The **charge cord Cc < 1 500 pF** (4) is shown as the cable parasitic capacitance. Keeping this capacitance low is necessary to preserve signal integrity for both the pilot PWM and high-frequency PLC communication.

4. **Ground/Earth Reference**  
   - Both EVSE and EV are referenced to a common ground for safety and measurement consistency.  
   - The standard requires that the pilot line operate with known references for amplitude measurement and duty cycle detection.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Function (Interpretation)

To interpret this schematic in a stepwise “flow,” consider the main functionality:

1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  
   a. The oscillator (2) outputs a ±12 V, 1 kHz PWM.  
   b. This signal passes through R1, Cs, and other pilot-conditioning components.  
   c. The **amplitude/state measurement** (1) on the EVSE side observes the pilot voltage amplitude to detect EV presence.  

2. **Pilot Signal Transmission via Control Pilot**  
   a. The pilot line travels through the charge cord.  
   b. **2× CPLC** capacitors on each side couple the broadband PLC signals but appear high-impedance at low frequency (1 kHz), so the pilot is only mildly affected.  
   c. The pilot line arrives at the EV’s circuit with R2, R3, etc., that set or detect the pilot level.  

3. **Pilot Signal Detection (EV side)**  
   a. The duty cycle measurement (5) block measures the incoming PWM signal.  
   b. S2 and the diode (D) can switch states according to standard charging protocols (e.g., controlling whether the EV is ready for charging, demands ventilation, etc.).  

4. **HomePlug Green PHY Communication**  
   a. The EVSE’s PLC chipset (3) injects high-frequency signals through a coupling transformer and **2× CPLC**.  
   b. The EV’s PLC circuitry also couples through an identical transformer and capacitor arrangement.  
   c. Inductor (L) and RDamp on both sides help shape or attenuate high-frequency noise.  
   d. This ensures data can flow between EVSE and EV over the same pilot line used for PWM.  

By combining these steps, the system achieves **both** standard pilot control (per IEC 61851-1) **and** high-frequency data communication (per ISO 15118 / HomePlug Green PHY).

---

## 5. Additional Notes for Engineers

- **Component Values**:  
  Table A.12 of the standard gives typical component values (e.g., L = 220 µH, RDamp = 220 Ω, CPLC = 1.35 nF, etc.). Actual values depend on the specific PLC chipset design and compliance with ISO 15118-3 and IEC 61851.  

- **50 Ω Considerations**:  
  Many measurement recommendations in ISO 15118-3 specify a 50 Ω environment (e.g., for spectrum analyzers, for measuring PSD). The design must ensure consistent 50 Ω terminations and minimal insertion loss in the PLC frequency range.

- **PWM Integrity**:  
  The pilot’s ±12 V amplitude and shape must not be distorted beyond specification. This includes ensuring the high-frequency coupling doesn’t degrade the 1 kHz pilot signal or the EV’s ability to measure duty cycle accurately.

- **Safety**:  
  Elements like the diode (D) and the resistor networks protect against transient conditions and ensure no unsafe voltages appear on the pilot line.

---

## 6. Summary

Figure A.13 illustrates a complete example of how to **inject HomePlug Green PHY signals** onto the **control pilot** between EVSE and EV, while still respecting the **IEC 61851** pilot requirements (±12 V at 1 kHz) and enabling **iso15118** high-level communication. Each component shown is carefully chosen to filter, protect, or measure signals at both low (1 kHz pilot) and high (1.8–30 MHz) frequencies, ensuring proper broadband communication and standard-compliant PWM pilot functionality.

Image Description for Figure B.2:
**# Detailed Description of Figure B.2 — Coupling Circuit for G3 Technology on Pilot Wire**

Below is a step-by-step, detailed explanation of the schematic shown in “Figure B.2 — Coupling circuit for G3 technology on pilot wire.” This diagram illustrates how the high-frequency G3-PLC (IEEE 1901.2) communication signals are coupled to the control pilot line between an EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) and an EV (Electric Vehicle). Although it is presented more like a circuit diagram than a traditional “flow chart,” the following description walks through each component and path in order.

---

## 1. Diagram Overview

- The diagram shows two main blocks labeled:
  1. **modem on EVSE** (on the left side)  
  2. **modem on EV** (on the right side)  

- Between these two sides, there is a **pilot line** that incorporates inductors (Lx1, Lx2), resistors (Rx1, Rx2), coupling capacitors (Cx1, Cx2, Cx3, Cx4), and other passive components.  
- Additional standard pilot-circuit elements (R1, C1, R2, R3, S1, etc.) are shown but described as “indicated for information only” in the standard.

   - A capacitor bridging the mid-line in the schematic, typically providing low-impedance coupling for common-mode signals across T2/T7. Its exact function is to aid in the high-frequency path or EMI considerations.

16. **Key**  
   - The figure’s reference text indicates “1” is the modem on EVSE side and “2” is the modem on EV side.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Signal/Circuit Path Description

Because this diagram is a coupling circuit rather than a traditional directional “flow chart,” the best way to describe its “flow” is to trace how a G3-PLC signal travels between the modems:

1. **AC Pilot Supply and Pilot Reference (Left Most Side)**  
   - A pilot signal or supply is connected through **R1 (1 kΩ)**.  
   - **C1 (300 pF)** goes from the pilot conductor to ground (node “0”) for noise filtering.  

2. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EVSE Side (Lx1 & Rx1)**  
   - After leaving R1/C1, the pilot line passes through **Lx1 (1 000 µH)** in series with **Rx1 (680 Ω)**.  
   - These form the mandatory high-frequency blocking or “choke” to keep the pilot circuit from shunting all high-frequency energy to ground.

3. **Coupling to EVSE Modem (Block “1”)**  
   - The pilot line node (between Lx1/Rx1 and T2/T7) goes to two coupling capacitors feeding the EVSE modem:  
     - **Cx3 (< 500 pF)** → Possibly connected toward the modem **In** pin, with resistor **Rx5 (> 10 kΩ)** referencing input impedance to ground.  
     - **Cx1 (500 pF)** → Possibly connected toward the modem **Out** pin, with resistor **Rx3 (1 kΩ)** as the modem’s internal source resistor for the HF signal.  
   - These capacitors pass the high-frequency G3-PLC signals but block low-frequency or DC pilot currents.

4. **Cable Assembly and Center Coupling (T2 and T7)**  
   - **T2** is the physical cable from EVSE to EV, carrying the pilot conductor (and possibly other conductors).  
   - **T7** is an in-line coupling element or test point. The standard simply shows T7 in the path, which might be used for measurement or for additional filtering.

5. **Series Inductor and Resistor on EV Side (Lx2 & Rx2)**  
   - On the vehicle side, the pilot conductor is again routed through another set of inductor and resistor: **Lx2 (1 000 µH)** and **Rx2 (680 Ω)**.  
   - As on the EVSE side, Lx2 and Rx2 ensure that the EV’s internal pilot circuitry does not excessively load or short out the PLC signal.

6. **EV Standard Pilot Connection (C2b, R2, R3, S1)**  
   - The figure shows some typical pilot-circuit resistors **R2 (2.7 kΩ)**, **R3 (1.3 kΩ)**, and switch **S1**. These are part of the standard IEC 61851-1 pilot function for controlling and detecting EV presence or charging states.  
   - A capacitor **C2b (1 n? )** may also appear, used for smoothing or filtering within the EV’s pilot logic.  

7. **Coupling to EV Modem (Block “2”)**  
   - Similar to the EVSE side, the EV modem connects to the pilot line through coupling capacitors and limiting resistors:  
     - **Cx2 (500 pF)** is the main coupling capacitor for the high-frequency transmit/receive path.  
     - **Rx4 (1 kΩ)** is the internal source/limiting resistor.  
     - **Cx4 (< 500 pF)** could be the receive filter capacitor.  
     - **Rx6 (> 10 kΩ)** is again an optional high-value input impedance resistor to ground.  

8. **Signal Path for G3-PLC**  
   - In essence, the G3-PLC signal travels from the EVSE modem (left block) → coupling capacitors (Cx1/Cx3) → pilot line through Lx1 + Rx1 → T2/T7 → Lx2 + Rx2 → coupling capacitors (Cx2/Cx4) → EV modem (right block).  
   - The mandatory values of Lx1, Lx2 (each 1 000 µH), Rx1, Rx2 (each 680 Ω), and Cx1, Cx2 (each 500 pF) are specified to ensure consistent attenuation and adequate coupling across a wide frequency range, while also meeting EMC requirements.

---

## 4. Connections and Relationships

- **Pilot Wire Core**: The pilot wire is the main conductor bridging EVSE and EV. It carries both the standard PWM pilot signal (per IEC 61851-1) and now the superimposed high-frequency G3-PLC signals.
- **High-Frequency Isolation**:  
  - Lx1, Rx1, Lx2, Rx2 form the series choke and damping sections.  
  - These prevent the pilot line’s normal low-frequency control signal from interfering with G3-PLC, and vice versa.
- **Coupling Capacitors**:  
  - Cx1, Cx2 provide the primary path for injecting/extracting high-frequency signals to/from the pilot line.  
  - Cx3, Cx4 are secondary capacitors for filtering or for the input side of the modem.
- **Resistive Networks**:  
  - Rx3, Rx4 are the output resistors from the modem perspective (limiting voltage amplitude).  
  - Rx5, Rx6 are optional high-value input resistors to ground or to the reference inside the modem, allowing minimal loading.  
- **Standard Pilot Components**:  
  - R1, C1, R2, R3, and S1 are from IEC 61851-1 pilot circuit definition, ensuring safe operation and standardized detection of charge states. They are “informational” in this figure but included so that engineers see the complete interplay between pilot function and PLC signals.

---

## 5. Additional Notes from the Standard

1. **Signal Level Requirements**  
   - Per ISO 15118-3 and IEEE 1901.2 references, the PLC signal on the pilot wire is limited to 0.5 V RMS maximum (to avoid interference with pilot PWM) and at least 0.2 V RMS to ensure reliable communication.

2. **Mandatory Coupling Values**  
   - Inductors:  
     - Lx1, Lx2 = 1 000 µH (each)  
   - Resistors:  
     - Rx1, Rx2 ≈ 680 Ω (each)  
     - Rx3, Rx4 ≈ 1 kΩ (internal source)  
     - Rx5, Rx6 > 10 kΩ (optional input)  
   - Capacitors:  
     - Cx1, Cx2 = 500 pF  
     - Cx3, Cx4 < 500 pF (exact value can vary)  

3. **EMC Compliance**  
   - Clause B.10 in ISO 15118-3 references EMC requirements from IEEE 1901.2. Additional filtering or decoupling elements can be added to ensure no more than 0.5 V RMS on the pilot-based PWM signal.

4. **Cable Assembly (T2)**  
   - T2 denotes the physical link between EVSE and EV. The standard clarifies that cable/detachable connectors must accommodate the pilot line for both the low-frequency PWM and the high-frequency G3-PLC signals.

---

## 6. Practical Engineering Takeaways

1. **Must-Have Components**:  
   - Ensure the presence of inductors (Lx1, Lx2) and the coupling capacitors (Cx1, Cx2) per the mandatory values if implementing G3 technology on the pilot line.  
2. **In-Modem Resistance**:  
   - The 1 kΩ resistors (Rx3, Rx4) help maintain consistent pilot-wire voltage amplitude for the G3 signals.  
3. **EMC & Filtering**:  
   - Additional filtering on power lines (e.g., at the EVSE side) might be necessary in noisy environments.  
4. **Pilot Circuit**:  
   - R1, R2, R3, C1, and S1 remain part of basic pilot architecture per IEC 61851-1:2010 Annex A.

### In Summary

Figure B.2 shows how a G3-PLC modem on both the EVSE (block “1”) and the EV (block “2”) couples their high-frequency communication signals onto the same pilot wire used for the standard IEC 61851-1 charging control. Key components—**Lx1, Lx2, Rx1, Rx2, Cx1, Cx2**—protect the pilot circuit from unwanted loading and allow reliable PLC signal transmission. The resistor-capacitor networks and optional additional filters ensure the PLC signal stays within required amplitude limits (0.2–0.5 V RMS) while still leaving the pilot function intact.

Engineers referencing this figure should pay special attention to the mandatory component values and overall pilot-circuit layout, verifying that each device (EVSE and EV) implements these coupling elements as specified by ISO 15118-3, Annex B, and IEEE 1901.2 to ensure interoperability and EMC compliance.
