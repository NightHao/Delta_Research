FIGURE REFERENCE: Figure 1: 7.3.1 Test configurations - Figure 3 — ISO 15118-5 test configuration

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
# Detailed Description of Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO‑0] in the ISO/IEC OSI Reference Model

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of the diagram labeled **“Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO-0] in the ISO/IEC OSI reference model.”** Although this figure is not a traditional “flowchart” (with decision diamonds or arrows depicting process steps), it provides a layered architectural view of how the ISO 15118 standards align with the classic ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. In the sections below, each labeled entity is identified, and its role and connections are described in detail.

---

## 2. Overall Structure of the Diagram

The figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):

1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑3 standard.  
2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** – Indicated by the “V2G standardized service primitive interface,” which bridges ISO 15118‑3 with the higher-layer protocols.  
3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑2 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO 15118‑1 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  

Within the big outer box labeled “Vehicle-to-Grid communication,” two standards are highlighted:
- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)
- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)

At the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.

---

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description

### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 1 Physical.”  
- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium—e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).

### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 2 Data link.”  
- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable “low-layer” communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 appear inside the “ISO 15118‑3” box. They are the core focus of “Part 3” of the ISO 15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized “pipe” for higher-layer messages.

### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface
- **Name in Diagram**: “V2G standardized service primitive interface.”  
- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO 15118‑2 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO 15118‑3.  
- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main “handshake” region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.

### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 3 Network.”  
- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).

### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 4 Transport.”  
- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO 15118‑2**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.

### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 5 Session.”  
- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO 15118‑2** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).

### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 6 Presentation.”  
- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer—handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.

### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 7 Application.”  
- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.

### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)
- **Name in Diagram**: “Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”  
- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of “V2G” communication from an OSI perspective—covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:
  1. **ISO 15118‑1** (General information and use-case definition)  
  2. **ISO 15118‑2** (Network and application protocol requirements)

  Where **ISO 15118‑1** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118‑2** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.

### 3.10 ISO 15118‑1
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑1.”  
- **Caption**: “General information and use-case definition.”  
- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (‑2 and ‑3).

### 3.11 ISO 15118‑2
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑2.”  
- **Caption**: “Network and application protocol requirements.”  
- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118‑1 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.

### 3.12 ISO 15118‑3
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑3.”  
- **Caption**: “Physical layer and Data link layer requirements.”  
- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118‑2) can function as intended.

## 4. Relationship and Connections

1. **ISO 15118‑3 → V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  
   - ISO 15118‑3 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.

2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface → ISO 15118‑2**  
   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO 15118‑2 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.

3. **ISO 15118‑2 → OSI Layers 3–7**  
   - ISO 15118‑2 “lives” across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.

4. **ISO 15118‑1 → Overall**  
   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO 15118‑1 supplies the conceptual building blocks—e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions—that shape the services needed in layers 1–7.

5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  
   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO 15118‑1 and ISO 15118‑2 is conceptually the V2G communication “stack,” reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO 15118‑3.

---

## 5. How the Diagram “Flows”
While not a classic procedural “flowchart,” the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:

1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  
2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  
3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  
4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3–7)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  

Each standard (ISO 15118‑1, ISO 15118‑2, and ISO 15118‑3) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers

- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO 15118‑3) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO 15118‑2), with ISO 15118‑1 providing conceptual underpinnings.  
- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  
- **Interoperability**: Each layer’s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor—covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.

---

**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO 15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

In correspondence to the identified set of relevant test configurations this sub clause defines test components which reflect the main entities needed for stimulation of the SUT with respect to ISO 15118. Ports are used to connect these components with each other and the SUT. Port types define which kind of messages can be sent or received by this port. All relevant components and ports are defined in Table 4 and Table 5 respectively. (sibling of Text 5)

These components and ports compose relevant test configurations for this document. Whether the type EVCC_Tester or SECC_Tester is to be used as MTC depends on the type of the SUT. (sibling of Text 5)

[V2G5-009] If the SUT is an EVCC, the MTC shall use the type EVCC_Tester. (sibling of Text 5)

[V2G5-010] If the SUT is an SECC, the MTC shall use the type SECC_Tester. (sibling of Text 5)

In addition to the MTC and PTC and their corresponding port type definitions, a test configuration also consists of respective Test System Interfaces (TSI). An abstract Test System Interface (TSI) is specified as a collection of ports. A TSI has no local timers, constants or variables. Only ports are assigned to it. During the test case execution test components ports can be mapped dynamically to the TSI ports to establish communication channel to the real test system interface. In the test configuration the TSI uses the type System_EVCC or System_SECC depending on the type of the SUT. If the SUT is an EVCC, the TSI uses the type System_EVCC. If the SUT is an SECC, the TSI uses the type System_SECC. (sibling of Text 5)

The test configuration is illustrated in Figure 3. The type of the V2G components and ports (EVCC or SECC) depends on the SUT type. (sibling of Text 5)

Figure 3 — ISO 15118-5 test configuration (sibling of Text 5)

As shown in Figure 3 the port mappings are defined statically as follows: (sibling of Text 5)

— The port pt_SLAC_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_SLAC_Port of the MTC. (sibling of Text 5)

— The port pt_HAL_61851_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_HAL_61851_Port of the MTC. (sibling of Text 5)

— The port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the v_HAL_61851_Listener. The pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port is from the same type HAL_61851_Port as the pt_HAL_61851_Port. (sibling of Text 5)

— The internal port pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port is not mapped to the TSI. This port is connected between the MTC and PTC. (sibling of Text 5)

The HAL_61851_Listener combines all necessary listener functionality into one component, independent on whether the MTC represents an SECC_Tester or an EVCC_Tester. The MTC always contains a TTCN‐3 test configuration and delimits the lifeline during test execution. Next to using ports for communication purposes, local timers, variables or constants may be assigned to components to store dynamic information during test case execution. (sibling of Text 7)

Related Information 42: These components and ports compose relevant test configurations for this document. Whether the type EVCC_Tester or SECC_Tester is to be used as MTC depends on the type of the SUT. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 43: [V2G5-009] If the SUT is an EVCC, the MTC shall use the type EVCC_Tester. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 44: [V2G5-010] If the SUT is an SECC, the MTC shall use the type SECC_Tester. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 45: In addition to the MTC and PTC and their corresponding port type definitions, a test configuration also consists of respective Test System Interfaces (TSI). An abstract Test System Interface (TSI) is specified as a collection of ports. A TSI has no local timers, constants or variables. Only ports are assigned to it. During the test case execution test components ports can be mapped dynamically to the TSI ports to establish communication channel to the real test system interface. In the test configuration the TSI uses the type System_EVCC or System_SECC depending on the type of the SUT. If the SUT is an EVCC, the TSI uses the type System_EVCC. If the SUT is an SECC, the TSI uses the type System_SECC. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 46: The test configuration is illustrated in Figure 3. The type of the V2G components and ports (EVCC or SECC) depends on the SUT type. (sibling of Text 5)

Related Information 48: As shown in Figure 3 the port mappings are defined statically as follows: (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 49: — The port pt_SLAC_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_SLAC_Port of the MTC. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 50: — The port pt_HAL_61851_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_HAL_61851_Port of the MTC. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 51: — The port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the TSI is always mapped to port pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port of the v_HAL_61851_Listener. The pt_HAL_61851_Listener_Port is from the same type HAL_61851_Port as the pt_HAL_61851_Port. (sibling of Text 5)
Related Information 52: — The internal port pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port is not mapped to the TSI. This port is connected between the MTC and PTC. (sibling of Text 5)

Related Information 53: The HAL_61851_Listener combines all necessary listener functionality into one component, independent on whether the MTC represents an SECC_Tester or an EVCC_Tester. The MTC always contains a TTCN‐3 test configuration and delimits the lifeline during test execution. Next to using ports for communication purposes, local timers, variables or constants may be assigned to components to store dynamic information during test case execution. (sibling of Text 7)
