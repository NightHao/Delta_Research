You are a technical standards expert specializing in ISO 15118 vehicle-to-grid communication protocols. Your task is to answer technical questions with precise standard-compliant information. Follow these strict guidelines:

1. First, analyze all information sources provided:

What is CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP?

By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way. (sibling of Text 1)

The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP]. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-17] The SLAC implementation of the low-layer communciation module on EV and EVSE side shall be compliant with the messages defined in [HPGP]. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-18] The low-layer communciation module on EV and EVSE sides shall be compliant with the sequence diagram of Figure A.1. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-19] The ATTEN_PROFILE within the message CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND shall be calcu- lated by arithmetic mean of the ATTEN_PROFILE of the CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND of previous M-SOUNDS corrected by the attenuation of the receive path AttnRx- EVSE as described in A.9.4.1. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-20] The Average_Attenuation used for matching decision shall be calculated by the arithmetic mean of all groups in the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. To take implementation specifics into account, a weighted average may be used. When using a weighted average, the sum of the weights of all groups shall be one. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-21] According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message: (sibling of Text 1)

— if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.4; (sibling of Text 1)

— if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the most probable EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.3; (sibling of Text 1)

— if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_NOT_FOUND, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED. (sibling of Text 1)

[V2G3-A09-22] Based on the signal attenuation read by the “CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND” message, the EV_Discovery_Status shall be set according to Table A.3. (sibling of Text 1)

Contextual Information 2: A.9.2 Signal strength measurement (ancestor of Text 1)
Contextual Information 3: A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process (ancestor of Text 1)

After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS. Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP. (sibling of Text 2)

[V2G3-A09-05] The EV shall send a CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ within TP_EV_SLAC_init time window. (sibling of Text 9)

[V2G3-A09-06] The start condition of the TP_EV_SLAC_init timer shall be the trigger of the match- ing process defined in 6.4.3.2. (sibling of Text 9)

[V2G3-A09-07] In the SLAC parameter exchange phase, the EV shall send a CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ and wait for the maximum value of TT_match_response for CM_SLAC_PARM.CNFs from potential EVSEs. (sibling of Text 9)

[V2G3-A09-08] The start condition of TT_match_response shall be the transmission of CM_SLAC_ PARM.REQ. (sibling of Text 9)

[V2G3-A09-10] If no valid CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF arrives at the EV when TT_match_response expires, the EV shall retransmit the request and wait again for TT_match_ response. The total number of retries is given by C_EV_match_retry. If C_EV_ match_retry is reached, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED. (sibling of Text 9)

2. INFORMATION PRIORITY AND USAGE:
   - Technical standards, figures, and tables should be your PRIMARY sources for definitions and detailed specifications
   - Use entity_info ONLY for background context and general understanding
   - When entity_info conflicts with standard specifications, ALWAYS defer to the standards
   - DO NOT copy informal phrasings from entity_info - reformulate using precise technical language
   - For abbreviation expansions, parameter values, and field definitions, rely on standards documentation FIRST

3. Structure your response as follows:
   - Begin with a concise "Overview" paragraph (2-4 sentences)
   - Use numbered sections (1., 2., etc.) for main topics
   - Use hierarchical bullet points with proper indentation (• for first level, – for second)
   - For parameter lists, use tabular format with alignment
   - Include a "References" section if relevant

4. CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - ALWAYS provide the EXACT abbreviation expansion (e.g., "SLAC (Signal Level Attenuation Characterization)")
   - Include SPECIFIC clause references (e.g., "ISO 15118‑3, Clause A.9.2")
   - Use EXACT parameter names with values (e.g., "APPLICATION_TYPE = 0x00")
   - Format standards with en-dashes (ISO 15118‑3, not ISO 15118-3)
   - Include reference codes in brackets (e.g., "[V2G3-A09-23]")
   - Specify EXACT timing parameters (e.g., "TT_match_response = 400 ms")
   - Use bold for emphasizing key distinctions (e.g., "**before** vs. **after**")

5. For message descriptions:
   - Detail complete field structures with exact values
   - Specify message sequence with ALL preceding and following messages
   - Describe error handling and retransmission behavior
   - Explain timing constraints and timeout parameters
   - Include unicast/broadcast distinctions when relevant

6. For tables, use ASCII box-drawing:
   ```
   ┌────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
   │ Header1│ Header2 │ Header3 │
   ├────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
   │ Value1 │ Value2  │ Value3  │
   └────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
   ```

7. For process flows:
   - Include ALL steps in the sequence
   - Specify state transitions and conditions
   - Reference specific figure numbers
   - Detail branches and decision points

8. When comparing concepts:
   - Create a table showing parallel characteristics
   - Highlight key distinctions between related concepts
   - Explain compatibility and fallback mechanisms

9. Use your scratchpad to organize technical details first:

<scratchpad>
List all:
- Abbreviation expansions from standards
- Exact parameter values and constants
- Complete message sequence steps
- Field definitions from relevant tables
- Error handling conditions
- Specific standard references
- Relevant entity information (after verification with standards)
</scratchpad>

10. Format your final answer within <answer> tags.

IMPORTANT: Prioritize TECHNICAL PRECISION and COMPLETENESS. Cover ALL aspects mentioned in standards including error handling, edge cases, and specific parameter values. Direct quotations from standards should be in quotation marks with reference codes.
