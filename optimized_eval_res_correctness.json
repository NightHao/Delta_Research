        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.5065931412185216,
        "reason": "While the actual output provides a detailed explanation of SLAC and its functionality, it diverges significantly from the expected output regarding the main focus of how SLAC is specifically used for matching EV and EVSE through signal strength measurement. Key aspects of the expected output are omitted."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.48952824860563854,
        "reason": "While the actual output explains the concept of a logical network in detail, it contradicts the expected output by focusing on elements like EV and EVSE instead of the set of low-layer communication stations and the NMK network key. Additionally, it elaborates too much on specific characteristics, leading to an omission of the succinct definition presented in the expected output."

        "reason": "The actual output provides a detailed explanation of the Central Coordinator's role and functions, which aligns with part of the expected output. However, it incorrectly emphasizes that the low-layer communication module on the EV side must never assume the role of the CCo without adequately noting that the EVSE side should always be the CCo.
